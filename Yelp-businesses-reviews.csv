"supreme-pool-tile-cleaning-la-quinta","""14/07/2023""",1,"Rudy came out to look at my pool.  He came across as professional in the beginning until the day he started working on my pool. I FOUND HIM TO BE  UNPROFESSIONAL.

I did not like that he showed up at 7:30 AM in the morning when I told him to come around  4:00 PM to set up the equipment and start draining the pool because my HOA requires draining the pool overnight.  At 11:30 AM, I got a knock on the door by my HOA to stop draining the pool. Luckily, I did not get a violation or fined by the HOA because Rudy did not follow my instructions. 

I did not like that he showed up 3 hours late for a scheduled appointment to do the Pool Acid Wash and cleaning the Pool Tiles.  Had to wait around for him, especially on a Friday Afternoon.  To me that is very flaky.

I did not like that he only spent 20 to 25 minutes total in the swimming pool doing an Acid Wash. I have a pool that is 8 feet deep and long. I am not happy with the result and to me it is poor workmanship.

I am not happy with the stain underneath my pool light cover because he did not take the pool light cover off.  I am unable to get the stain out.

I am also not happy with the sealer he put on the tiles. He missed areas and is sloppy in other areas. 

I am not happy that he left my skimmer and skimmer cover a mess.

After the pool plaster was dry, I looked over his work the next morning.  I called Rudy to address my concerns about his workmanship.  He did call me back, but I found him to be completely UNPROFESSIONAL in addressing my concerns. I tried texting him back again the next day, but found it to be completely useless.

I decided to cancel the check I wrote him because I felt ripped off.  

He gave me a call about the canceled check and was willing to reduce the amount on the bill. However, he threatened me with a Mechanics Lien on my home if I did not pay. So, I was left with either clouding my title of my home with a Mechanics Lien or paying him for work that I felt was unacceptable. 

I am not happy nor satisfied with his work and especially his customer service. Having to dealing with Rudy throughout the process was stressful, a complete headache, and I felt I got ripped off.

I made a big mistake by hiring Supreme Pool Tile Works and I will not use them again and would not recommend him.","{""Friends"":4,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/ZsnnPE-Ts4dvlE0rAHt17Q/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""CA, CA"",""Photos"":5,""Reviews_made"":18,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ehDNBwcHa4Kltjvj2jkyzA"",""Username"":""Tim M.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vG9onsL2syX7cg0qdCzCDg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HYvV-cAOpFErax4YuyEJLQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/79YsR4g-vJZtNvZ7rnmQmQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Qfb4tD0Pw8BAccmdP5l34w/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nP3IB9MdCCrFdk_fLYbt-w/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xnp2s_Mm6vBiQRPIFqbXHQ/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",4,"","0 check-in","Supreme Pool Tile Cleaning"

When he came out the first time he got lost, passed our house. So this was flag number one. Doesn't everyone have GPS at this point? 

So for the service, they came out scrubbed the pool, adjusted the chemicals, in turn in doing this clogging the pool filters (that they didn't clean or tell us needed to be cleaned) so that the heater didn't get enough water pressure so the pressure switch burned up, he also adjusted all of the settings so that we now were heating the whole pool with the heater instead of our solar. The heater is meant for the hot tub that wouldn't work anymore.  He says he has been in the pool business for 50 yrs!!! Maybe he needs continued education to stay up on the times!

I would steer clear of this company if you have a pool and expensive equipment. Could potentially cause major problems and damage.

I had to make several phone calls to receive a simple confirmation email for the service. There was a lack of communication from the start.
Despite the lack of confirmation, I received an invoice, which I paid, and then I was then sent another invoice for a full month's service for the first of the month, before any service had been performed.
Upon returning home, I was met with a shocking sight. The pool line was clogged with leaves, the pump had no water flow, and the pool itself was green. It was filled with leaves, debris, and even some dead toads and lizards! I had to pay another company to come out and repair the damage to the pump and filter as well as the stains all over the pool. This is completely unacceptable for a company claiming to provide pool maintenance.
My neighbor reported seeing the service technician only once while we were away. This lack of consistent service is inexcusable, especially considering the price I pre-paid.
Overall, this company failed miserably on every level. The lack of communication, premature invoicing, and blatant neglect of the pool are unforgivable and failure to keep their promises.

I recently had Elite Power and Solar install a battery system in my Forrest River 5th Wheel. Adam and his team were very helpful and professional. Adam helped me choose how much battery power i was going to need, and the equipment I should use. He explained the whole system and how it was going to work. Adam and his team brought all of the equipment and tools needed for the install. The system install came out very clean looking for the area and professional.

We got a lot of features for our pool, as well as a built in bbq and large concrete patio deck. Everything was done with high quality of craftsmanship when completed and we have had nothing but compliments. Even other contractors comment on how nice the work was done.

I was looking for someone to help me with very minimal move out cleaning.

The tasks I asked for were:
Wiping down cabinets, walls, fans, blinds
Cleaning a small bathroom
Stove
Refrigerator

I paid $170 for an hour and unfortunately I received the bare minimum, and not even all what I asked for. The fans, walls OR cabinets all did not get wiped down, the fridge and the stove were both only half way done, the shower did not get wiped down and the bathroom lights did not get dusted.

Upon very kindly asking the cleaner about it afterwards, I was ignored, denied my tip refund request and blocked. (I simply asked for the $20 tip I gave to be refunded, after 3 hours of talking with them they sent me $10 but requested it back after I left a negative review)

"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""14/08/2024""",1,"I have been coming to Porto's since they only had one location. My family ordered pastelitos and potato balls for every single family function ever since I can remember. No matter whose birthday, it was a cake from Porto's. Christmas wasn't complete without a bunch of pastries both savory and sweet.  

I ate so much Porto's growing up I thought I was Cuban. It honestly pains me to write this review but it has completely gone downhill. The food is still excellent and the prices are still affordable in todays economy but the service at every location is horrible, no one seems to care, there is a huge lack of customer service, no one seems to know what the hell they are doing, literally!! This location is probably the worst one of all. Even the managers are a mess. 
They promote special holiday items on social media, you pre order online, pay and when you come to pick up, not only do they not have it, they don't even know what you're talking about and look at you like you're the crazy one. After this experience, I spoke to somebody in their customer service office and really expressed my honest thoughts, but nothing has changed. 

The location is beautiful. I was so excited to bring my boyfriend (who has eaten Porto's for years but never actually dined in) to try the breakfast and sit down and enjoy a cafecito and some delicious Cuban food. But it was such a terrible experience that he said he would never be back to eat here and I agree. The ordering was a mess, cashier didn't know what he was doing, then our buzzer kept going off literally every 2 min (but we were dining in) they didn't bring all of our food out and when we said something to the runners they claimed that they did, then flipped it and made us show a receipt to prove what we ordered. Employees kept coming around the corner peaking over at us, it was so uncomfortable I felt embarrassed honestly because I spoke so highly of eating at Porto's to my bf and after literally 10 months of trying to plan a breakfast date here it happens, and then we have this awful experience. 
By the time the fiasco was resolved our food was cold. 

They hire a bunch of kids now who don't even know the menu, don't have any interpersonal skills or basic customer service. Their system is faulty, and messy, every single time I have come to eat here it's such a cluster f*** for lack of better terms, but that's really what it feels like. Get it together Porto's. I just left and had a similar experience of employees telling you to pick up your food at X and they don't even have your full order in the bag. I had to go back and then they sent me to where the cake pick up area is for the rest. I honestly don't have the energy anymore, coming here used to be enjoyable, now I come to get stressed. So sad.","{""Friends"":580,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/qtvA4xotpdGTlmUk7bxz6g/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Sylmar, CA"",""Photos"":3523,""Reviews_made"":378,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3AWA4lLJJESedTxP1begWQ"",""Username"":""Jennifer G.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dJ6ESpqESFUixEUi-9IKhQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/F9Mu4CkLQSX9lNXPGHz_Rg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cmzEM0oyK1FgBcnR0fkvRw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nY82DfznZOZjA-kDBbMdGQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5VqNNWeHS-CBQn4w4PVBGg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZCb7vkvMIY8PXx0BxnVT2A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m067iy_D8uQyE5pTBrL1yQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Npnu3uDH8WsEGfKFRwJNWA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ruAkFUki30yu3hvIGlibwA/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Hello Jennifer, \n\nThank you for taking the time to write a review.

"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""29/05/2023""",5,"There's not much more to be said about Porto's that hasn't already been said by others, but Porto's really is a gem in LA. Porto's shows that excellent pastries and desserts can be affordable even in a city like LA, and honestly whenever I visit other pastry shops, I am always comparing it to the value I get at Porto's--and rarely do the other places outshine Porto's. 

My favorites at Porto's are the almond croissants and the coconut pastries. I think it is the perfect level of sweetness and of lightness, so that you don't feel too overwhelmed by decadence but also can still quite full after a few pastries. The seating here is ample too, and it's a good combo of indoor and outdoor seating. It's a lovely atmosphere to just relax and enjoy your food.

As others have said, a major pro-tip is to order ahead if you have a large order so 1) you can be guaranteed what you want and 2) you don't need to wait too long in line. One disclaimer I will add is that there is still sometimes a short wait for the online order pickups too.

This location in particular is most accessible compared to Burbank or Glendale. Parking is abundant and the interior is spacious (almost reminiscent of an airplane terminal). Their lines may look long but they have staffing to match. Lines
 can go as quickly as 10-20min at 8pm on a weekday.

There's bomb seasonal items or rotating meals to freshen up the menu. During the xmas season, their cakes glam up to have the holiday feels and things like their turkey and gravy balls and gingersnap cookies rotate in.

My dad LOVES the cheese rolls; he can't come here and not get one. My mom on the other hand, favors the savory meat pies and sandwiches.

I enjoy everything here LOL but I will say sometimes the filling in their potato ball series can be a bit too salty  but fire with tabasco sauce (scorpion peppa baybee) 

Also I dig their compostable plating.

"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""20/04/2022""",5,"Porto's strikes again! So happy they opened a location closer to my home and yes, as obviously expected, they have been CRAZY busy since opening day! I swung by Saturday 4/16 around 4:30pm walked out about 5:30pm with my food, so an hour from waiting in line to walking out isn't too bad!

While we waited in line, one of the managers greeted everyone and asked us if we had any questions. We were greeted again by a woman at the door and then the amazing friendly service at the counter by everyone taking out orders. I was helped by Ciara who was very sweet and made sure to get everything I ordered right!

I picked up a variety of things, some old some new to me - 

Cheese rolls - the BEST. So crispy and crunchy on the outside with a light sugar dusting to add some sweetness and crunch. The cheese filling is creamy, tart, decadent, so good!

Guava cheese (refugiado) - a crispier, flakier puff pastry filled with the sweet guava jam and creamy cheese. Wonderful!

Carrot cake - this was a first for me, overall it was not bad but I would never consider this a ""Carrot"" cake. I feel they put too much pineapple and pecan to make it distinctly a carrot cake, while the cinnamon is also a lot. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this cake slice, but if you're specifically looking for ""carrot"" cake, don't expect that from this. It was also not overly sweet and the cream cheese frosting was rich and delightful!

Napoleon - a great interpretation (actually it's a mille fuielle but bakeries in America change it to Napoleon all the time). Crispy and flaky pastry with a rich and not too sweet custard.

Mamey - always love the mamey smoothie here, fruity and tropical with added sweetness from the milk and sweetened condensed milk.

Chicken croquette - this is one of my favorites - crispy on the outside holding together the rich, creamy, absolutely amazing croquette filling! 

Potato ball - crispy like the croquette, with smooth mashed potatoes wrapped around savory beef and veggies. 

Tamale - I love Porto's or just Cuban tamales in general and think they are some of the best versions. The masa is moist and mixed with corn, and the filling has juicy and tender pork.

Parking isn't too crazy since you have all the mall parking, and the location looks beautiful!

5 stars for top not notch customer service and quality, quantity of the food.

Very reasonably priced, I always come out happy from this place...here is why:

1. The facility is impeccable in every sense of the word. So beautiful inside and out. Plenty of seating area to dine in.
2. Customer service never disappoints. The staff is always helpful and nice
3. Prices are so reasonable for everything they sell.
4. Quantity and quality is always good  

Sometimes seeing a long line discourages to visit and buy. But these people have definitely got it under control. The line was out the door for about 2 to 3 blocks and we were out in a little under an hour. I was expecting to wait atleast a couple of hours. Infact I almost left but decided to wait instead.

"pressure-washing-near-me-pensacola","""29/08/2024""",1,"WARNING!  Do not use a business called ""Pressure Washing Near Me"".  The owner's name is Justin Mullins and he is in Pensacola.  Here's my sad story.

Justin and a helper pressure washed my house back in April.  One of them laid the pressure washer wand down, apparently holding the trigger, and washed a hole at the corner of some brick steps.  I saw the wand laying there with the nozzle pointing down in the hole, while they were still here.  I even think I mentioned it to them but they left without fixing the hole.  

I am 81 years old and have been chronically ill with a very painful disorder for decades and have no family to help me.  I very seldom leave the house because of pain, so it took me a long time to get out and get something from Lowe's to fill the hole.  I packed it down tight and then when it rained the next time, another even larger hole appeared on the other side of the steps underneath the gutter downspout. What had apparently happened was that the force of water didn't just make the hole I filled but went under the steps and blew a hole in the underground ducting that is attached to the end of the downspout.  The ducting directs the water down the hill in my front yard away from the house.

So everytime it rains, water pours out of that hole and gets bigger and I'm afraid it might be causing my brick steps to cave in.  I called Justin and he is refusing to come fix it for me, denying that it happened by him or his helper.  I saw the wand laying nozzle down in the hole while they were here.  I have already backed into that hole and twisted my ankle.  Somehow I have got to figure out how to fix it myself before I lose my steps because funds are very low as I have been ill for many, many years.

He won't take responsibility for what happened.   He told me himself that his helper was ""just helping"" and he was obviously not familiar with pressure washing as Justin gave him directions on what to do.  I saw the wand pointing down in the hole while they were here so I know exactly when it was done.  I even picked up the wand to look at the hole it made.  It certainly wasn't there before they came.  The hole in front of the downspout only occurred recently after I was able to get out and get some dirt to fill the first hole.  I have had my irrigation man come take a look at it and he says the damage was definitely caused by a force of water from the pressure washer.  Justin is accusing me of lying when he knows what they did.  When the black ducting is replaced, I will add a photo of the hole in it from the water pressure.","{""Friends"":0,""Location"":""Milton, FL"",""Photos"":12,""Reviews_made"":3,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CSOh-9fJPe04nTHAPlf_8Q"",""Username"":""Melody ..""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QKUPFOdHmbIklEsGcH9Tog/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kahJ_1EoBwTgB8SO0NQAdA/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",1,"","0 check-in","Pressure Washing Near Me"

First of all the place is spacious and modern and spotless. The service is spot on and the bakery goods on display made me feel like I was in a high end jewelry store only I could eat the stuff in the cases!

I ordered the feta cheese, tomato and basil sandwich on French bread to stay and a slice of napoleon and a slice of carrot cake to go.  If you know be by now I'm a bit of a carrot cake freak...Hahhahaa! 

They boxed up the baked goods that I wanted to go and then give you a tracking device that will find where you are sitting so they can deliver your food.

After we were finished we got back in line to get the oatmeal raisin cookies.  Then I swear I almost got back in line to get the mixed berry muffins!  But I'll wait for next time.  

Their prices are epically affordable...and this is officially my new favorite spot!  

Their smoothies looked amazing so I'll get one of those too!

Don't get me started on their cakes. Do not go anywhere else. Go there. End of story.

Again, my desserts were delicious but the service makes me wonder if it's worth the chaos that could have been easily corrected. -Shame","{""Friends"":61,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/iW3BXDuXyYKhnuntU0VfNA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Northridge, CA"",""Photos"":192,""Reviews_made"":124,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=n69AOjFragnusjSxzoAemw"",""Username"":""Sally L.""}","null","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Hello Sally, \n\nThank you for taking the time to write a review.

"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""13/06/2023""",3,"A first time visit for us to this new Northridge Porto's Bakery and Cafe. We're long time patrons of the Glendale location. And my first impression? Huge. Everything so new and clean. A well oiled machine.

We dropped by on our way to visit our eldest son who lives nearby. Ordering a good variety of edibles to go; like the must have potato balls; chicken and pineapple empanadas, guava strudel, grilled chicken cilantro Caesar salad, Cuban style black bean soup, corn & poblano peppers soup, plus a slice of carrot cake. Along with a requested steak torta and spicy chicken melanesa sandwich for my son and his girlfriend. A good sampling I would say.

But here's my take. We arrive with our two bags of prized Porto's to our destination and start spreading out the feast. My plate consisted of one of the potato balls, Caesar salad, chicken empanada, and a bowl of the black bean soup. But compared to the numerous Glendale Porto's flavors I've savored over the years, something just wasn't right. Bland even. I didn't care for the empanada; way too dry. And the potato ball's taste did little for my taste buds; and I love love love Porto's signature potato balls! At least the many I've relished in the past. Even after arriving back home and heating up another I wasn't sold. The black bean soup was decent, but the Caesar salad probably won out in this taste testing. And the pineapple empanada I tried after arriving back home? Not a fan! I'm disappointed. Truly disappointed sorry to say. The wife and I will split the carrot cake tomorrow and I'll give the corn & poblano pepper soup a try for lunch. I'm anticipating, hopefully, a better outcome.

I'll give them another try in the future.","{""Friends"":2743,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/PPsLrjMvvgfMibOieRYKAA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Santa Clarita, CA"",""Photos"":3738,""Reviews_made"":923,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=H-ROZEeDUP5j4DjLXn8iOA"",""Username"":""Ronald M.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TWH5QmvjTMMiIlboXxh3zg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oNbO6T2PupCS2tVu_ASfWw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QCatvnY8Wjv18hzOXIxMag/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ey8Wjk78CqJFzRr-4RnFhQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CnR0Q-fkCrp3kvf83Kq8jw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/K17k8q7PQ5RCyWtSE1JnZA/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":13,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":5,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",207,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Porto's Bakery and Cafe"
"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""23/12/2022""",5,"There's a reason why Porto's is this successful(many reasons I guess)
You can only imagine any place would be having crazy business during the holidays, and I was already mentally prepared when I decided to bring dessert from there for Xmas. I ordered on their website to pick up and it was so easy, limited selections on smaller items but totally understandable when they have to take care of the amount of orders.
I got there, the staff at the door asked me for the order number and I was able to go right in without waiting in line. It's 7:45 and the line was about 50 people which is actually not that bad for them, it does move quick.
Once I got inside, there was only one customer at the ""CAKE"" counter where people pick up the pickup orders.

They asked for the order # again and in 5 minutes everything's together ready to go! It's so efficient it's amazing. 

Due to my recent hand surgery I wasn't able to pick up the cake and bunch of stuff myself, they have staff helping customers moving stuff. I waited for about 10 minutes but again I can only imagine how busy they are with the amount of activities. She was extremely helpful and friendly which made the whole experience even better for the crazy holiday!

Totally recommend to order it ahead of time, so convenient :)","{""Friends"":62,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/BBiI0ggEeZme1ffIkGuDBQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Porter Ranch, Los Angeles, CA"",""Photos"":1401,""Reviews_made"":434,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DJQAv8CwJpIKHvbrTcz4oA"",""Username"":""Jeanette Y.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lnC8g-3dnxFN1wM-c09iqQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FRXO_iyre5KRwqbdjhQzrQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TeQNTkCqdc0OCKqc3NpM4Q/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EkdjIhankp6aeyUP7gjtjA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Aat0MQIqriKmxuwPIoEcRA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Cb-2IN8Y123NAhvNxJD3BA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OBA3nahW0yB9mWCpaina-A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iWvvhBbN7a5joe8mBfZYkg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/k__MY2td_aLZ8fwv31KXdw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_ONofTVtyHuwWYinNfVSwg/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""First time visiting this location and it did not disappoint!\n\nThis location just opened couple weeks ago and everything is brand new and nicely done.

I got the rustic chicken salad for about 10 dollars. I didn't like that the bacon was sweet but otherwise it was a good salad option. My cousin got the ropa vieja, which he said was decent. 

We were given our baked goods and then a buzzer for the servers to find us when our entrees were ready. The service was quite efficient. 

We then shared the croquettes. I liked the chicken the best as the potato was too cheesy and the sweet corn was too sweet. 

For the sweets, we shared the tiramisu and strawberry pistachio tart. They were good, but not amazing. What were amazing were the cheese rolls. They were divine and so cheap. Skip the guava cheese roll and just get the regular ones!

If I lived here I would definitely try their cakes. It was insane to me that a full cake serving 6-8 ppl was under 30 dollars.

I ordered some potato balls, a guava cheese strudel, some cheese rolls, and a spinach and feta empanada, plus a dulce de leche ice blended coffee.

I tried the iced Ube Matcha Green Tea Latte during my last visit in June.  I'm a bit ube'd out from all the businesses jumping on it.  This one was ok.  Sweet and you can taste the matcha and ube.  But you're better off getting ube from a legit Filipino spot.  I did try the clam chowder in a breadbowl.  That was pretty good.  Clam chowder was hearty and the bread bowl was fresh.

Typical go-to is the parisian cake, one of my favorites!  The triple chocolate mousse was my ultimate, but they stopped that during pandemic.  I hope the triple mousse makes a return!  Please?

I am more familiar and lucky to know the Glendale and Burbank locations. When the Northridge location was going to open I thought the two previously mentioned locations will start to become easier to navigate through. Nope, I was wrong. People just flood all locations getting their delicious pastries, sandwiches and desserts. 

Coming to the Northridge location for the very first time I was amazed on the size of the establishment. There are tons of seats and multiple stations inside to order your goods. On a Saturday morning, around 9:30am, people were already there handling their business. At times you would have to wait in a line to enter the building for orders. Our group that met up only stopped by to hang out for a bit and have some coffee together. With about 15 people in our party and ordering at different times, it took over 40 mins for everyone to receive their drinks. 

I don't really have any business to come to this location. I would recommend coming by during the week day when I would assume the crowd is far less. But I would definitely recommend checking out the establishment as it is a beautiful one.

Parking: large private lot shared with Northridge mall

"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""30/09/2022""",5,"Our Adored Grandson was offered a job at this new Porto's, but it took a while longer to get ready to open, so he went a different direction.  Because of that almost-connection, we were looking forward to trying this location, and got the chance last weekend.

We'd had dinner nearby, and were in the mood for a dessert fix.  As we walked over the façade made a big visual impression.  Getting closer, the line out the door then caught our attention.  They have a café section with both indoor and outdoor seating.  The line was mostly for the bakery counter.

We found the end of the line, which moved pretty quickly.  I liked that they had a team member at the door directing traffic and monitoring the flow of guests entering the building.  Once inside, we discovered it was like Disneyland - another snaking queue inside to go with the one outside!

As we got closer to the front of the line we started to see so many amazing pastries, cakes, cookies, and specialty items.  The hard part is deciding what to order!  The staff members have iPads and take your order, then go fill it and bring it back to you.  I wandered away from Dear Hubby to look at other parts of the building and take pix (for Yelp!), so I didn't see how the payment part went - whether he had to go wait at the cashier stand, or whether the order taker just handled it with their magical technology in hand.

The baked treats get packaged in bright yellow boxes with cellophane windows to offer a peak at the goodness inside.  The quality of each item we tried was outstanding, and we were pleasantly surprised at how reasonable the final total was.  DH went for the mango cake, and I had chocolate cake.  Wonderful taste - light and airy; not too sugary.  We will definitely be back!  Preferably not on a Saturday night when it might be at its most crowded.

Maybe one day they'll decide to expand to Ventura County.

As for food, sadly as a vegetarian, there are no sandwich options available (that I noticed at least). Their tres leches cake is actually my favorite tres leches cake!

"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""13/11/2022""",5,"WOW - Porto's has always been my favorite place but this is the first time I visited the new Northridge location and it is huge!! Ample parking in the parking lot, too.

It's like a massive hotel lobby, with three sections (cafe, bakery, and a coffee stand). Bathrooms on-site. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. It's like a palace of pastries!!! I always recommend ordering online (same day ordering only, but you can place the order late at night the night before). It's always busy - there is always a line - so ordering ahead makes the trip easier. They ran out of almond croissants by the time we came for pickup, but they kindly replaced those with pastries of our choice AND gave us three muffins on the house ""for the inconvenience"" even though we didn't complain! Very nice!! We might have just gotten lucky since we came right before closing. Pro-tip: there wasn't a line at the cafe but they still sell some pastries there if you just want to dip in for a quick drink and pastry.

I also ordered a cake - the milk & berries is quite possibly my favorite cake EVER! Definitely try it! I also personally love the chocolate croissant and the refugiado (guava and cheese). I tried the cheese roll for the first time too and it was a good mix of sweet and savory. The churro croissant is basically their standard croissant with cinnamon sugar (good but probably wouldn't get again) and then the pumpkin muffin was tasty and HUGE - perfect for pumpkin fans.

The thing I love about Porto's is that they stay true to their values - they are family owned, they are consistent every time in terms of quality, and the prices are SO AFFORDABLE!

It was a site to see but also definitely not surprising. I'm so happy to have one literally in our hometown and with better parking! We have been to the Burbank and Glendale locations but both have tiny parking. The first and only time we went to the Glendale location was during pandemic and they were only doing online pick up orders which was tbh very convenient.

My mom ended up going to this new location to have dinner with friends and I was very surprised! I didn't think she would be down to wait in a long line but she did and said it wasn't too bad and definitely worth the wait.

She grabbed us a few goodies like the classic cheese rolls which are a must, some Napoleon cake thingies, potato balls which are also a must and delicious with cholula, some empanada things, and the plantain chips with the absolute best garlicky, citrusy dip I've ever had! I didn't even know it came with a dip till my coworker told me about it recently! Glad I was finally able to try it and it's my favorite snack. They also have delicious iced, bottled coffee which I completely forgot to ask my mom to get. There's always next time! Can't wait to visit in person and see how beautiful the inside is!

It's located at the edge of the parking lot at the Northridge Fashion Center. Parking is plentiful and easy to find.

My party of 3 went on Wednesday night around 6 and it was popping. They have two lines (one left and one right from the main entrance) for ordering, so just pick the side with the shortest line.

Ordering is straightforward. The menus clearly list their signature sweet and savory items as well as entrees, and for everything else, you can peruse the display case and see what looks good to you. Prices are very affordable as well. We ordered a ton of food, including one sandwich, our total was only $33.80.

There's a separate area where you can order coffee and tea, smoothies, fresh orange juice, etc. 

There's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, and even a lounge area if you're just here for drinks or some small bites. We found the main seating area with tables way too cold, so we opted to sit in the lounge.

Of the items we ordered, my favorites were the cheese roll ($1.19 each), ham croquette ($1.39), and the chicken milanesa sandwich ($9.59). We ate a couple items at the store and took the rest home to eat later.

Chicken Sandwich was perfectly toasted on the outside and proportioned with the lightly crispy fried chicken, cheese and tomatoes but I wish there was a bit more of the avocado spread  . 4/5

Chicken torta was ok for me. The beans kinda over powdered the flavors of the torta in my opinion. I think it's would've been great without or just a thiiiiin spread . 3/5

Cheese rolls are a MUST! 

Guava cheese rolls are second ! 

DULCE DE LECHE COOKIES!!!!!! Warmed up in the microwave for 6-8seconds is even betterrr! 5/5

Potato balls and Croquettes are a staple 5/5

Meat Pies have a great flakey crust but there wasn't enough meat to crust ratio inside this time. 4/5

Raspberry matcha eclair was subtly delicious. 4/5

Since the item on top was correct I didn't even think to double check. We had placed a to go breakfast order and instead of French toast we were given a turkey croissant sandwich. A bummer that we did not notice until we were home. So be sure to double check your food onsite.

If the line is short and you are not sure of what you want to order step off to the side to give yourself time to think. Though, it can be difficult to see what is in the cases until you are in line. But, we felt like we were in the way in line but not sure what we wanted yet. You can order your coffee and drinks from the cafe line. If you order to go you'll pick up your food order across from the coffee bar but you'll pick up your drinks at the coffee bar. They do have drink stoppers available upon request. I highly recommend the dulce de leche latte. It is incredible!! The medium size is $4.99 pre tax which is a great price compared with other coffee spots.

I was severely disappointed at my Porto's experience and I'm not sure if I would trust coming back to this one or any of them at this rate 

I placed an online order for pickup, and the receipt, and confirmation email both said it would be ready at 3:30pm and that's what I planned for. 

Nowhere in any of the above says that some items are made when you arrive, but it says that your order will be ready for pickup, I needed to be at LAX for my flight so that's why I gave myself wiggle room to pickup and go down knowing it would be bad 

Some slight traffic as expected to get to Porto's but I arrived maybe a little before 4pm and if it's ready then all is well. I've even seen Porto's during thanksgiving and the line is out the door and madhouse, and my pickup still only took 15min tops 

So I check in, she tells me a few minutes to wait, I see the people in front of me get their bags, one person needs Porto's employees to help take it out to her car. So 20min or so pass by and someone behind me gets their order so I ask where I'm at in the queue, and the woman says a couple more minutes. Now 4-5 more people behind me also get their bags ahead, with another person having a big enough order to warrant Porto's employees help. Finally after 45 min of standing around like an idiot they finally gave me my bag, and obviously this cut into my buffer time and spoiler alert because I didn't expect to be at Porto's for 45min, I missed my flight to LAX, and since I had to rush to try and make my flight I couldn't even check to see if it was right, and turns out I was missing a couple items 

I was obviously pissed that it was never told to me that some items are only made fresh when you arrive because that would've factored into my time or I wouldn't have ordered them if I was informed either in the confirmation or in person. I had to pay $90 for a new flight that Porto's didn't do anything to try and rectify.

I'll usually order the chocolate twist, croissants, dulce kisses, chocolate chip cookies, empanadas, and muffins, which are all seriously delicious. You can't go wrong with anything. Their lattes and frappes are also great. I place orders for pick up because the line is normally outrageously long. You can't get some of their food items to-go though, so I did wait in line once and ate inside. It was crowded but the seats were comfortable.

The wait time to order goes by quickly and gives you time to drool at the pasties while standing in line:) They have sandwiches, salads, soups, a variety of drinks as well as an espresso bar...and let's not forget...PASTRIES & CAKES! An endless supply in fact!  

I tend to order the same thing.  I know, so boring of me...but I like what I like: turkey croissant sandwich with tomato, lettuce and cheese. Here is the annoying thing, if you order a sandwich to go, YOU DO NOT GET PLANTAIN CHIPS! I repeat, you do not get plantain chips! Same exact price! This pissed me off.  Next time this girl or ordering it to eat in! I will ask for a container as I leave! Ha!!!

The Cubano sandwich is also popular here.  My family loves it.  I think I will stick to my go to order.  The drinks are good and the strawberry matcha iced is yummy and I am ""not"" a matcha kinda girl.  

~Once you order your food, etc., you wait for your baked goods as they fill your order, pay then get a number for your ""eat in"" items. They will bring them to your table. 

My Highlights: 
*Huge parking lot 
*Plenty of outdoor & indoor seating
*Very clean inside and outside
*Friendly service at the food/bakery counter 
*Restrooms are huge and very clean 

Lowlights:
*What's up with No Chips with your ""to-go"" sandwich? I call BS! They make you pay for a side order which is $4 extra! 
*When they get busy the baristas aren't the nicest","{""Friends"":570,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/QQ-nSVrLUGzdfElWZsy3Hg/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Valley Glen, CA"",""Photos"":5544,""Reviews_made"":690,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=2lUj2d-52lhkAjN5LmZwRA"",""Username"":""Te-see B.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Y0qT74LiyeU1HyFNb9_j6g/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ppbCjJPPZFVVXkiic0TW4Q/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hxakuAfV5JrDDIhSF59svw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YoaAmosOI9lWuIvBbjHYRg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/huxwX7civ7E427-9k2BJuA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qzseSBWsMYA2vZbi3uWwuw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/os35lMSk23DowZ7oP38kLQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YLjwqVISMwymXR5zBFcJzA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XFmqYYqnlk1N63BfXhia5g/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":37,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":8,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":46,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",123,"Elite from 24","5 check-in","Porto's Bakery and Cafe"
"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""25/11/2023""",5,"I love Porto's and usually go to the Burbank location but decided to check out the new location in Northridge since it's a little closer to where I live. I came the day before Thanksgiving to get a cake which I had ordered online in advance the morning of pick up. I highly recommend doing this since the line was out the door and around the corner!! It might have been extra chaotic due to the holiday but I'm glad I did the scheduled pick up since I was brought to a separate line and did not have to wait as long...plus they gave me the option of including add on items when I was getting the pick up so I was still able to get several pastries, coffee, and fried goods without waiting in the longer line. 
Service was excellent and very efficient despite how busy the place was. It felt like this bakery was working like a machine. The location is also so beautiful! There is a very large open space and many windows which bring in natural light. We added on to our order some cheese rolls, Refugiados (guava and cheese roll), besitos de Dulce de leche, croquetas both of ham and also chicken, as well as a sourdough batard and coffee. 
Even though the croquetas and sourdough were very very good, my favorite out of this batch was the cheese roll since it comes with a crispy, flaky crust, and has a nice mildly sweet cheese filling inside that is creamy and not too sweet. I like how the sugar on top caramelized to crispy in the oven which gives this pastry a little crème brûlée resemblance with the creamy filling. The besito de dulce de leche was also splendid! It is a small crumbly cookie similar to that in alfajores that is filled with a very mild and creamy dulce de leche. I could eat like 10 of these. 
Finally, the star of the show for me was the Milk'N Berries cake we ordered to go which we used for after our Thanksgiving dinner. This is truly the absolute best tres leches cake I've ever had in terms of subtleness of the sweet flavor, sponginess of the cake, and moisture levels. I've ordered it every year for my birthday for the last 4 years and it has never failed me. For this occasion, they were kind enough to top it with a cute little ""Happy Thanksgiving"" white chocolate plaque which I appreciated. It was a hit dessert after the dinner! 
Porto's is amazing and having this location in Northridge with a more modern and clean appearance, but with the same exceptional quality of baked goods and reasonable prices, is a blessing! Will definitely make a stop whenever I'm back in Los Angeles without exception. Highly highly recommend this place.","{""Friends"":42,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/9s8RflUCGmuOyJSPYBE4jg/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""New York, NY"",""Photos"":1161,""Reviews_made"":244,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=B_3SHlcstzC9btkwQQJpdg"",""Username"":""Isabella T.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IZIhVtJfn7s8vbJVPST6mQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ebWyqr-63PKm2bI4n_xNLw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_S03cAt_-mQtYdHzd9j1IQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pAOZhGTAh_dShAjr59Ag8g/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/coVay8Mw-mJcDf2L77gr3w/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wpEsJz_90XmVrYC5YH3Uow/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",137,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Porto's Bakery and Cafe"

There is a large selection of mouth watering baked goods that are freshly made daily (very early in the morning), so that they are ready when it opens its doors to its ardent devotees at 6:30 am.

"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""13/05/2024""",4,"Let's cut to the chase--your pineapple cake is better than the cake in Burbank location. 
Far better. 
Check my previous reviews of Burbank location: the first pineapple cake I bought from Burbank was delicious, maybe the best cake I've ever had. 
The second time I bought the pineapple cake from Burbank, it was frozen in the middle, then liquified the next day. I tried to save it in the freezer, and ruined it. 
Third pineapple cake from Burbank had the same ice in the middle problems.
I bought a pineapple cake from your Northridge location yesterday, it had SLIGHT icicles in the frosting that dissipated and took nothing away from the experience. I just ate more of it today, and it was EVEN BETTER THAN YESTERDAY--no liquifying, no problems, same great taste. 
So my question to you, Porto's, is: why can't Burbank get it right? Is it the refrigeration unit messing up? 
Burbank--send people over to Northridge, and mimic their setup, because you dropped the ball too many damn times, and I'm only going to Northridge now, I don't care about the drive or the traffic.","{""Friends"":5,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/0VhClmHyZn7vqTvUosvasg/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Los Angeles, CA"",""Photos"":13,""Reviews_made"":140,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=rjgXFqCKsXUTjf7VDBSAPg"",""Username"":""J.

Even was pretty packed still on a Monday afternoon when I went!
They have two main bakery lines for all of the food items that you can order. It seems like the lines are long but they move pretty quickly and have your food out at a reasonable amount of time, depending on what you order and how much you order. It's a really loud environment so be prepared to scream your order to the employee as they prepare your items! I dream about the potato balls and they are a necessity to try if you have not already!
The drinks are quite delicious too! They have a separate drink bar aside from the food so you don't have to go in the long food line for it. Would definitely come back, maybe on an off day.

Yes there was a wait and multiple lines of which I'm told is an everyday occurrence because the food here is so good. Let me go on by saying the wait is not long as the lines are directed in quite the organized manner and move quickly. The service was quick and pleasant. We even got to watch the magic unfold as one of the workers drizzled mango sauce on their pastry through a window. They are known for their cheese rolls here but after purchasing $70 worth for our family, we can safely agree and say that anything that is from here is pretty delicious.  The ambiance is beautiful and allows for multiple seating areas where it was quite tempting to grab a seat and sit and sample more. We will certainly be back for more!

I came for lunch and ordered some pastries and a sandwich with some drinks.  They do it differently here as you place an order they do not pack it from the display cases like the Burbank and Glendale locations, but they get the pastries from the back which is nice.  It takes a few minutes to get your order together.  Since I ordered a sandwich and drinks those took a short while to make as well.  The Hortchata Coffee is really tasty, perfect blend of horchata and coffee.  I also had a lemonade drink which is perfect for the heat.  They serve drinks in a cup or bottle (same price and same ounces).  I suggest if you're getting an iced drink to get the bottle that way your cup isn't filled with mostly ice.","{""Friends"":375,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/ct2payx5hX9u3L3Iyt7TCg/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Los Angeles, CA"",""Photos"":23012,""Reviews_made"":3200,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=TwjiWvK0ZP15lzGC049oIQ"",""Username"":""Darylynn D.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LgxPNZIBnIsXFr3OcaviWA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eKmLN67dS9qtEAM5-y-4Bw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9SFTL3cnheDlaTcKUm4GsQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JfrBOgw0GX9dn9OYkqHXRQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/705-RdFqJjrWjNgh4bGEXA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EO_EyHiZxxXh8AExSTq7Yw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",306,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Porto's Bakery and Cafe"

And when it did, I had no qualms waiting in the long line with all the other eager locals. Why didn't I mind waiting? Because as with all other Porto's locations, I knew the line would move quickly. And it did/does. The team there knows how to get customers in, take their orders, and get them to the dining area. It's a very well oiled machine. Something other fast casual restaurants could learn from. This location is also massive which means there is enough room for 2 huge ordering counters. They are technically broken out into one side just for sweets and the other for ordering food, but so far they have been using both sides for food. Will this eventually change? Maybe? But until now, it just means the line moves even faster so I have no qualms!

The food here is just as good as every other location. That is to say: delicious. And this location also has a unique cake. It's a pineapple Cuban cake and it's delicious. My wife and I bought it on a whim, not knowing if we'd finish it and it was gone in 2 days. It's light and just the right amount of sweetness. I highly recommend it. (Just make sure you don't fill up on potato balls & other treats to the point where you don't have enough room for dessert). I will say, however, that this location seems to be hit or miss with the side orders of fried plantain chips. I always order some to bring home and they've only had them once or twice when I've come here. And when you get some as a side with your meal they'll just give you 3 or 4 which is a huge disappointment. Hopefully they'll get to a point where you get more with your meal & they have plenty leftover to order sides to bring home. 

Needless to say, having a Porto's closer to where I live is a blessing. One that I will be taking advantage of as often as I can. And if I eat to much (which will happen every time) I can just walk it off at the mall right next door!

Until August 12, 2024 I was put into the line on the left and I ordered 6 Duce de leche besitos, 4 chocolate chip cookies , 2 apple strudels, 6 cheese rolls, 2 cinnamon rolls, 6 spinach and feta empanadas, 4 chicken croquettes and 1 ropa vieja sandwich. Unfortunately I couldn't get the name of the woman who helped me because her jacket covered her name tag, but on the receipt it says Fernanda. When checking out I was surprised there were only 2 medium sized boxes for everything I had ordered. While waiting for my sandwich I checked the boxes and found that my cheese rolls, apple strudels, besitos and chocolate chip cookies were all squeezed into one box, my problem was that the besitos and the chocolate chip cookies were placed on top of the cinnamons rolls, which caused them to have the cinnamon roll frosting on them. I was shocked to see this considering every time I've ordered besitos and the chocolate chip cookies they were always placed in their own containers. Fortunately I got help from Damian, and showed him the box and based on his expression, he also knew what was given to me was wrong. I would give Damian a 5/5 stars he was very helpful and understanding to my situation.","{""Friends"":0,""Location"":""CA, CA"",""Photos"":0,""Reviews_made"":2,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JQiGd3boBZsXoC9lzDNTYA"",""Username"":""Bella A.""}","null","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Hello Bella, \n\nThank you so much for taking the time to write a review.

"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""19/05/2024""",5,"Been to this newest Porto's Bakery location only one time.  It was the day after my birthday, and we took my parents.  It was their first time ever stepping into the door of a Porto's Bakery.  They were impressed!

Like all their other locations, this Porto's was extremely busy.  Line outside the front door.  One of their staff members monitors the line outdoors, then directs folks to go inside.  Once inside, you see more craziness with more long lines.  Good thing is that the lines go quickly.  Organized chaos!!  

For this visit, we purchased our favorite sweets to take home.  Happy to say that they all tasted just as yummy as their other locations make.  Good to see that all the branches are consistent with how delicious they make their food.  We also decided to eat lunch here so we all ordered sandwiches.  They have plenty of tables available to dine at either inside or outside.  That day, though, all the tables were full.  Fortunately, we were able to snag a table for the 4 of us after about a 10 minute wait.  Soon after, our sandwiches were brought to us.  All yummy too!

This Porto's Bakery in Northridge is the closest one to home.  Although, it is still almost a 90 minute drive from my house.  Any plans to come to Bakersfield?  Probably not a good idea cause Porto's would put a lot of bakeries out of business if they came to town.  They consistently make great baked goods and sandwiches.  Prices are very affordable.  Food is high quality.  Service is terrific.  I've got nothing bad to say about this family business.  I've been a fan of Porto's Bakery ever since my first visit to their Glendale Branch in 1998.  It's been great to watch them grow and expand their locations!!

I ordered a variety pack of food to transport me back to Little Havana, Miami! My order was a dozen of pastries ham croquettes, potato balls, chocolate hazelnut besitos, and sandwiches. My favorite items by far were the ham croquettes, all the potato balls, cheese rolls and guava cheese pastries!Personally I would have to pass on the roasted pork sandwich; it was two dimensional and didn't have enough acid to cut the richness of the pork & butter. I had plenty of cubanos and medianoches during my visit to Miami and the sandwiches in Miami had more depth of flavors (ie pickles, mustard, and hot off the sandwich press). The ropa vieja was much better compared to the roasted pork in my opinion. For both of these sandwiches a side of pickling, maduros, or platanos would make a marked improvement for the price. 

Service: 5 out of 5
Friendly and easy to pick out your items for the to go process.

Environment: 4 out of 5
Large and spacious building. Atmosphere felt more like a large restaurant rather than a cafe. An area of improvement would be to include a gender neutral options for an inclusive environment.

The almond croissant was light, flakey, and the perfect companion for my coffee the next day. 

The biggest letdowns for me were the Parisian slice and the mango mousse. Just kind of average for my taste, nothing to repeat here. I know lots of folks love their cakes... but I've never been the hugest fan.  Alas. Lots of other stuff to munch on. And after waiting for 45 min for the baked goods, I didn't feel like braving the other line for coffee. 

We didn't dine in but it was exceptionally packed on a Wednesday at lunchtime, so if you want to fight it out for a table, you'll need backup.

I've been going to Porto's for-ever.

First loved it when I had their cheese rolls and the Cuban sandwich at their Glendale location.

Then loved going to the Burbank location cause I worked in Burbank and it was easier to access than the Glendale location.

Now I work in Northridge and this one is in Northridge!!!  How awesome!  The parking is ample, so even if there are lots of cars there, there is always parking because someone is leaving.

I would highly recommend not coming on a major holiday, to any of their locations :) but if you must, order online first.  For a quick bite, just go straight to their coffee stand.  You can get a drink and something quick, like whatever pastry they have there.

I love the consistency!  Every location has great food.  Every location has great customer service!  Every location is just great!  The ambiance is welcoming.  The space is alway inviting.  The smells and sights, displays of their offerings whether it is the breads, the desserts, or the cases, all look great!  Must see, must try, just a must for everyone to visit any of the Porto's locations, and there are so many now, it's easy to access, so no excuses.","{""Friends"":212,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/jvThz59TC24b1sg0YuLbpw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Los Angeles, CA"",""Photos"":273,""Reviews_made"":50,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=58FH9aMzWGOC7qGg7ngP4w"",""Username"":""Vee P.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_LN-HvOacckdFUJ7x24LNQ/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",68,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Porto's Bakery and Cafe"

In addition the baristas were not only taking coffee line orders and prepping drinks - they were receiving orders from the bakery line. Everyone is wearing gloves which is good. However, kinda pointless with everyone touching different surfaces without changing gloves. Money, drink tops, coffee pots, cleaning counters. \n\nThe ordering and pick up process is not really efficient.

"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""06/01/2024""",4,"Porto's is known for being incredibly popular and busy. My reason for giving them four stars is because 1. The service is fast and friendly, 2. The cakes and pastries are delicious, and 3. price point is pretty reasonable! Some items I recommend include: the fruit tart cake, strawberry cheesecake, potato balls, cheese rolls, and horchata cold brew! 

On the other hand, I deducted one star due to the coffee bar service.. they don't have the most efficient way of having their guests pickup their coffee order. The baristas do not call out any names or numbers to indicate which order is ready to be picked up... Most guests ended up having to ask the workers (after waiting for a while) which order belonged to them. I am not entirely sure if this is something that happens on a daily basis but it did occur the last few times I was there. 

Tips:
-place your orders online for same day pickup to avoid the long lines!
-if you have an online order, walk to the front and show the worker your confirmation code! There is a separate line for online orders

It's the closest one to her and I had a craving. I haven't had Porto's in forever so I knew it was in the cards. What I didn't consider to be in the cards was it was also the last day of school and graduations for many, so our wait was approx. 40 min start to finish. It wasn't too bad, things move like a well oiled machine around here and it was lunch time. I hadn't been in so long, this provided me the opportunity to brush up on their menu and all of the yummy items I was fixin' to order.

Everything was yummy as per the usual. Some of my favorites are the midnight sandwich (but I did notice, this didn't come with plantain chips like I was use to in the past so I was a bit bummed) no carb was left behind although I didn't get my plantain chips - I also ordered a couple potato balls, one cheese and spices one regular, a Napoleon, a couple cheese rolls, dulce de leche kiss cookies, a cafe con leche and a couple other items I didn't end up eating much of that day or the next (a chicken croquet and spinach feta empanada).

Porto's never disappoints, they are one of those businesses that has simply just nailed it in terms of quality, price, and service.

I was confused at first because the line on the left says ""Bakery"" and the line on the right says ""Cafe"" but you can still order anything from their menus regardless of the line titles. 

The pastries order came out fast since the cashier puts it together in front of you at the bakery line. I got a pager for the sandwiches and drinks order so the cafe will bring it out when it's ready, which was convenient. Lots of seating indoors and outdoors of the restaurant. 

Everything tasted flavorful and filling. I enjoyed my pan con lechon with the 3 pieces of plantain chips along with my iced pumpkin spice latte. My boyfriend devoured his cubano sandwich with the few pieces of plantain chips along with his iced coffee. We also tried the chicken croquettes and potato balls before our entrees and rinks got delivered.

The service is top notch here and they all have asked if we were waiting on more food or if there was anything else we needed. Great spot to meet up with friends for a delicious bite and beverage if you don't a little wait :)

P.S. also, they have a strong no-pets-inside policy so outside dining was perfect in the back of the restaurant with the shade :D","{""Friends"":953,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/mrNmy8MyofSQTpvtOOH_5A/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Moorpark, CA"",""Photos"":3361,""Reviews_made"":802,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ysmGZFFmavPKtQiyBKME7g"",""Username"":""Youri Y.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jFG3es81LedV_ZkDnV2-BQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4XMLQWsN308p0n5kWhZLcg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eTQTyT3dw4pwuTo64cDASg/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":6,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":4,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",252,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Porto's Bakery and Cafe"

Their new Northridge location is amazing. What's equally great is that it's down the street from my house. Huge interior space with an outdoor patio and plenty of seating. It's located next to the Westfield mall, so there's ample parking. They just opened recently so expect long line when you arrived. The line moves fairly quick though.

On my recently visit, picked up a few meat pies, dulce de leche cookies and cheese rolls recently which are divine. Their hot plated dishes like their ropa vieja, leachon and citrus chicken are fabulous. It comes with white rice, black beans and plantains which are perfect compliment. Prices are steal under $10.

We stayed in the salon area where was a very decorative Christmas tree.
There were many employees coming and going with the orders, but there was also one of the employees was responsible for keeping the area clean. I wish I could get his name. He was wiping the tables and sweepong the floor very frequently.

Their service is also good every time I go; I don't have any complaints. The lines have shortened recently so there's a shortish line to order normally. The building itself is really beautifully decorated and designed. I love looking up when I am i the line and seeing the ceiling pieces. It's usually loud inside of the eating area because there's always a good amount of people so I usually like to eat outside if it's not too hot.

Second time dropping in at 8:30 and Porto's already a party. Honestly I don't even question why. Porto's doesn't hit the community with inflation they relate with us as humans.

Quality is always great especially for the pricing wow.

That's what stepping into Porto's Northridge shop feels like. It is HUGE. As in airplane hangar scale. Not what one expects in a bakery.

Now, many lifetimes ago, when I was a baking student at LATTC, snagging an apprenticeship at the original Porto's in Glendale was considered the brass ring. And, frankly, I stopped thinking about the growth that this family business has experienced since that time. It has literally exploded. There are currently six stores all over SoCal and two more in the works. Wowa!

I needed some pastries for an event and wanted something scrumptious, unique, and, well, top quality. I thought of Portos and was astonished to see there were stores beyond the original, excellent, landmark on Brand.

I will let the pictures do the talking. Porto's has much, much more than pastries and I only scratched the surface of their offerings in that category. You could literally go there for breakfast, lunch, and dinner many times over and not try it all. They must be doing something right -- the place was packed on a Wednesday morning, of all the crazy times.

Btw, you can order online, set the time to pick it up and it is ready, warm, right from the oven, and presented in beautiful boxes nestled in a very cool bespoke tote. Double wowa!

Now I want to hurry to all the other stores to see if they are as amazing as the one in Northridge. Artists, these are baking artists and we should all just go and watch them work their magic, to learn ...","{""Friends"":108,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/rSFBfH8fXiGSV4fMVPKQTw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Los Angeles, CA"",""Photos"":1702,""Reviews_made"":233,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=inSfpOENZ7UqpXedJZvXzQ"",""Username"":""Liz L.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3Kg3bKiwFy1iztbP4r6f4A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/euoN0Ewa9L5MwzaO7xX1zQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ABCj5aAuLFhon_y_16fWGg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZNaqmrPIoioeMh1Xj74Zfg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zRHIoJwojritGe0koQtbTw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/m_DmPS53BKfNx_Jla2gm1Q/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ayNpTG5RhW23Hnty54iUIA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9BeLnNPsFSw1u2myjaxycw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uDo_lmvgj-Gp349BlAZyng/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jjp1giUKfvwYunyJTyU-ww/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",11,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Porto's Bakery and Cafe"

I've only ever ordered their baked goods for pick-up to-go since I always saw the long line from the outside. The dining area is very clean and the interiors are inviting. The pastry case is definitely a very tempting sight to see as soon as you walk in. I definitely picked up some to take home to family. 

Finally decided on the 4th of July to dine in and see what it's like to wait in said line and was so pleasantly surprised by the service I received! Despite what was sure to be a long holiday wait, the line moved really quickly and the service was quick and friendly. They made sure to ask me how I was doing and make a bit of conversation even though deep inside I bet they all were just hoping to catch a breath to get the queue moving. 
Food was served almost as soon as we sat down and staff made such good effort to turn the tables around quickly to make sure people could get seated. 

My pan con lechon was delicious and plentiful for a good lunch portion. My ube matcha latte was so good! As a filipino diner often I find that people confuse taro and ube flavors and think them interchangeable. This really tasted like the ube flavors I had growing up in the Philippines. 

Highly recommend, will definitely come back. I'll never be deterred by the line again. The prices are Porto's are honestly unbeatable for the quality of food you get.

I was surprised to see that there were still a lot of people coming at such a time, but with the prices of their items, I don't blame them! We got assisted right away at the entrance on where to line up for. As I chatted with my girlfriend and passed the time away, I was enthralled to see such tasty and delish-looking items on the display case!! I was so excited and added a couple items onto my original planned order.

We got the mini pumpkin pie, the potato balls, a dozen cheese rolls, and pork tamales!
Oh my goodness-- I'm not a big fan of pumpkin pie like that, but I decided to try out the pumpkin pie because it looked so good, and I was shocked at how good it was. 'Woww!' I remarked in my head. The crust was thin, airy, and light with the flavor of the pumpkin being so creamy and tasty.
The potato balls / cheese rolls are a staple of my Porto's order so they were as great as always. Potato ball with the perfect exterior crunch, soft potato consistency and savory meat flavoring inside. Then the crunchy but fluffy and airy cheese rolls with delicious cheese stuffing inside!
The pork tamales were good but I feel like those could probably be better, however they were filling enough that I had extra to eat for a different meal time.

All in all, enjoyed eating here and felt really happy my girlfriend suggested coming here!

For the longest time we would line up in Glendale and would order cheese rolls and guava cheese rolls for visitors during the holiday or as something to bring to a party or when we go visit out of town friends and family.

So I am really glad when they opened a branch in Northridge.  Compared to Glendale and Burbank this place is huge and feel less cramped.  That being said I've been here few times for to-go and dine in.  In 2 occasions despite how big this place is the line can still be out the door at certain times.  For dine in - I've been here weekends for brunch so it's been really crowded.

Just a tip - if you're only coming to only pick up pastries - just order online and schedule for pickup.  You don't have to fall in line and you can go straight to the pick up line inside the store.  However don't order drinks or hot food because you still have to wait so if your goal is to be in and out- don't include hot food or drinks.  

Aside from pastries my favorites are their ham omelette and French toast.  Empanadas and cakes are good - love the fruit tart.

All joking aside, there really is nothing to gripe about when it comes to this establishment. Long lines? That's because it's good. Stale food? Get an air fryer you amateur. Not authentic? We live in one of the largest melting pots of culinary delights so educate yourself. 

I love the chicken croquettes. This is my absolute fave. Top it with some hot sauce you're good. Its beautiful twin is the potato ball - both OG and spicy. Put some balance in your life and get both. 

The next best thing is the guava cheese rolls. Thank me later but not your scale. 

Any of the cakes will boost your celebration - the fruit tart, the tres leches, the lemon me that is doused in milk, Mexican chocolate, anything goes. Pick one and you'll be happy. 

If you're an LA native or a tourist and never been to Porto's bakery, scratch this off your list of places to try because it is worth it.

We ordered some sweets and main dish which were 4 sandwiches but they didn't give us none of sandwiches. 
We spent over 30 dollars for those. 
And the lady cashier was repeating the name of the food and checking what we ordered, how come she didn't put them in the box. 
We live kinda far away so we couldn't even go back to get the food.

Northridge is no exception. Staff is friendly, energetic, helpful and efficient. Prices are the same reasonable prices elsewhere.

What I can add is that I had their rustic chicken salad for the first time and I am thoroughly impressed at how good a simple chicken salad is. I wish I worked near a Porto's because for less than $9, I can have a great lunch.

"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""10/03/2023""",5,"My mom and good sis accompanied me on a lil trip to Porto's after a day at the beach. We arrived after 6pm and this place was bussin'!
It was our first time here and were at first confused how to go about ordering our selections. 

After a minute we soon put 2 and 2 together and noticed lines at different stations of the place. The Bakery, Cafe, and Coffee Bar. The line for the cafe moved pretty fast as there are many workers moving quickly. I ordered the Steak Torta, some of their popular potato balls, and my mom ordered their Cubano. At the Coffee bar, I ordered a Dulce de leche latte and my sister tried their insta worthy strawberry matcha latte. 

We found a table and our food was out in a jiffy. The Torta was a very filling size and had great flavor and a lot of meat! It was a great value. As was my mom's cubano. The sandwich was a smaller size but still had a mouthful of savory flavor. 

The latte's were amazing! After stirring our drinks their quality and sweetness brought me back to life. I really loved both! 

Overall it was quite the experience, the ordering/shopping experience feels like I was shopping at a mall which was a little different compared to how I am used to ordering food but the ambiance was great, food was delicious, and we will for sure be returning.","{""Friends"":35,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/90ju8zXLtMFerQ177oh0gw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""San Fernando Valley, CA"",""Photos"":494,""Reviews_made"":230,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=7cf_CZgPH3X6mVtRNLon5g"",""Username"":""Ethan Z.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/88RrkpbdcJrkVdCHkHQzng/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",197,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Porto's Bakery and Cafe"

Impressive location, appeared much larger than the Burbank location. Great service that is associated with the Porto's name.

All good, no complaints here as the wait was definitely worth it. Kudos Porto's.

The food was fresh and reasonably priced as in all other Porto's locations.

For drinks, we got a passion colada smoothie and a horchata cold brew. My mom enjoyed (and finished!) her passion colada smoothie, which was sweet and refreshing. I did find the horchata cold brew pretty balanced, but it was a bit bitter for me. It might be perfect for people who love the bitterness of cold brew, though!

We split a Chicken Milanesa sandwich to leave room for snacks, and it was definitely a good pick! The chicken was flavorful, and the breading was crispy. We loved the soft bread, and noted it had both a saucy spread and avocado spread, as well as some slices of tomato and cheese. It was a great combination of flavors!

The pumpkin muffin was crispy with crumble and pumpkin seeds on the top, but soft and moist on the inside. Perfect for fall. :)

We also got the cheese and spicy pepper potato ball, which had the crispy outside, smooth potato inner layer, and a center of creamy cheese and flavorful bites of pepper.

My boyfriend brought me here since he said this is the newest location and knew I didn't eat breakfast yet. 

As someone who literally always orders cheese rolls and potato balls, I expanded my horizons by trying the ham and cheese omelette sandwich. The croissant was so crispy and honestly this is such a great idea. The idea of an omelette with these sides makes it impossible for anything to fall out. I've been trying to recreate this at home but it's not the same.

PRO TIP: the ""cafe line"" serves the same thing as the ""bakery line"" and the wait is always much shorter so definitely use the cafe line.","{""Friends"":21,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/ypRL-eCAFR8TYuTB5Vj_iA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""San Diego, CA"",""Photos"":464,""Reviews_made"":137,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=gazSiewwD5n0Dnq9og16Fg"",""Username"":""Nicole K.""}","null","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",472,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Porto's Bakery and Cafe"

Also If you're hesitant to go cause of the long line outside the door, the line goes pretty quickly. Once's you're inside, you're not waiting no more than 5-10 mins to place your order, but I do recommend if you're not alone, to have someone save your seat since finding a seat can be tricky, unless you're okay sitting outside in the sun. It also has a good view on  the bakers, making there pastry's when you enter. It's really nice to see there process if you're curious. Other than the great smoothies, sandwiches as well as pastry's.

"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""11/06/2023""",5,"What else can I say about Porto's that hasn't already been said? Porto's is an LA staple for Cuban light fare food and pastries. Porto's continues to grow due to its popularity and demand. It's really nice having a Porto's closer to home now, as before the Northridge location opened, I'd have to frequent their Burbank location (my OG spot). 

This Northridge location is humongous! I was shocked at how big this location is but thankful as somehow it is still as busy as any of them. You'd think more room would equal everyone being more spread out but definitely not the case here, you just have room for even more people to crowd around haha. Plenty of parking considering it's LA. As with anywhere the earlier you come the better shot you have of getting close by. The decor of this new bakery itself was gorgeous. They did a great job designing this store, it's a fresh look and very cute outside with all of the seating.

Staff here are stellar! I could never work somewhere like here so I'm always extra grateful and impressed with workers who crank out the food, deal with the craziness of the masses, all while having a smile on their face. They have so many employees here that they definitely keep the long lines moving. Today a trainee Angelina helped me out and she was lovely. She was patient with me while I looked around and asked questions, but also speedy to get my order out.

Everything at Porto's is delicious. I love their Cuban sandwiches and guava inspired drinks or coffees. My number one bite to put in my mouth though is the meat potato balls. I've loved these ever since I was a kid and when I go I'll always order a dozen of them. Next I'd highly recommend the guava and cheese strudels plus the simple yet delicious cheese pastry. Everything I've ever tried here has been good and made fresh that day. Quality food and ingredients. It's a real treat when you get the chance to go to Porto's. 

Well, this location is killing it and it's nice to have a big and new location open in the valley.

Solid 5 stars all the way. When you compare this location to Burbank. You'll see that this location has plenty of parking. You'll see that the layout is very easy to follow.

I really dislike the one is Glendale. The Glendale location wants you to pay for parking is crowded with people just going to view and not buy.

The con about this location is the restroom. It's located on the other side of where you sit down and eat.

I had no idea what I was getting myself into, I've come back 3 times since then. Best Cuban sandwich I ever had. The mustard, pickles really stood out, quality ingredients. The bread was crusty, but not to hard. The seasonal peach tart made my mouth water. The peaches were so fresh and juicy! I thought they were going to be smothered in a peach jelly to keep the peaches fresh. But they weren't, it was just delicious fresh fruit with a delicious crust and cream. The croissant, was good, but it needed more ham and cheese. I didn't mean to pop the cheese balls so fast. They were just so good! The lines look so long, yet they have it running so smoothly.

"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""29/11/2022""",5,"How excited I was to find out that Porto's Bakery & Cafe was gonna be in Northridge! I kept asking my bf if the building was finished getting built & Finally. It seems like this is one of the biggest Porto's I have been to. I think Northridge & West Covina locations are huge. Lots of parking available since it's on the other side of Northridge Mall. They share lots with Golds Gym. 

I wanted to wait till they got all their kinks out... 
Found out they did limited online ordering, so I did that a couple of times... With online ordering, I was able to bypass the outside line & walk right in to the pick up counter. You still have to wait while they gather all your orders, but it's pretty organized... I like how they have everything spaced out. If you wait in the regular line, a worker asks how many people & directs you to either Bakery line. You get helped by 1 worker: they take your order, box & bag it up, & take your payment. They have tap to pay & mobil device payment available. Workers have been helpful & polite. 

My usual To Go orders: 
Sweets: Cheese Rolls - $1.05 each or $11.49/dozen
Refugiado (Guava Jam & Cheese Strudel) $1.19/$12.75
Savory: Potato Ball, Chicken Croquette & Plantain Chips

Try the Cubano (Cuban Sandwich). I suggest to eat it there, unless you eat it right away if you take it to go. 
I need to dine in here still. There's lots of seating inside & outside at their patios. I have yet to try their drinks. Lots of drinks...

My friends love this restaurant, so they often come here on the weekend for lunch  - which as I've seen is definitely a very very busy time for them. Even while training new staff on busy days, everyone has an upbeat attitude and works efficiently to get orders out. The queue moves very quickly. 
The ingredients are always super fresh and I love the plantain chips!
I tried the Turkey and Gravy potato balls, a chicken empanada, a croissant sandwich, a mini, pumpkin pie, and a mocha latte. ALL ARE A+ on the tasty scale!
Their prices are so reasonable! Please never change!
We found a table outside and sat in the shade, and the people I was with said that the wait time was longer than normal. I still thought that the food came out in a very timely manner. The outside patio is beautiful; well shaded with spots of sunshine. My only gripes are the person who was letting their children run and jump onto and run around the planters upon which I was sitting (at my table.) Also, the double parking in front of the entrance should not be allowed. Somebody should be outside enforcing that. There's only so many times you can hear a car horn right in your ear when trying to enjoy your lunch and have a conversation with your friends because some entitled person is blocking the only way around or way out.

Straightforward order at the bakery counter. The line situation was nice. We didn't need to experience it, ourselves because we were early enough. On our way out, though, we noticed greeters directing traffic. Staff were on walkies keeping each other informed about the building crowds.

Our handful of cheese/guava roll orders were put together very quickly, so we were in and out in twenty minutes.

The first mistake was a couple weeks ago, the guy taking my order wrote it on a note pad with other orders already on it and when it came time to pay they were trying to charge me for multiple different items I hadn't ordered. 

Today, Thanksgiving Day I went in early morning 6am for a couple pumpkin pies, and I also ordered 2 tamales bcus I've actually heard they're pretty good but never had. So, they charged me for 2 tamales and when I get home I realize there's only one inside.

Prepare to stand outside for a bit being able to go inside and order. Parking can also be a bear. But it's by the mall so you'll definitely be able to find a spot even if it's not close. 

My go tos are some version of the potato ball, they have cheese, beef, and rotate between chicken, seafood, turkey etc throughout the year. They also have the famous cheese rolls that are sweet and tangy with cream cheese. Their Cesar salad is hearty even without meat. It has big coarse pieces of kale so make sure that's your thing. The dressing is great. I also like their soups, the corn is my favorite when it's in season. On this trip I tried the blueberry pastry with fresh whole blueberries on top. It was so good! 

They also have plenty of delicious drinks to try. Seriously you can't go just once. You'll need to make multiple trips to try different things each time. Oh and if you don't like waiting, consider using mobile order pick up. It can save you time. Just be prepared to pick up a few hours from when you order.

There are a lot of people walking in and trying to get their orders. However, they have several stations which made it easier for customers to get their orders without waiting.  It took us only 10 mins wait time to get in front and made out orders. We have their Cubano sandwich. A guest favorite! House-made, slow-roasted pork, sweet roasted ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, and Cuban dressing (mustard, mayonnaise, and house seasonings). Served on a Cuban roll and pressed. It also comes with a side of plantain. 
Their coffee station is different and you have to order separately. Their choice of hot drinks varies but we have their hot coffee with our breakfast. 
Before we left, we also had their favorite cheese rolls and coconut strudel. There are so many pastries to try and take home and you'll have to come back and try them. 
The place also serves cakes and desserts. There's a section where you can see bakers at work preparing.  It's so fascinating to see how the pasties were made from scratch. 
Once you ordered, your server will bring your meal to your table. When the food arrived, we noticed that the counter didn't take one of our orders correctly. The manager came to our table and told us that they will make the order free of charge. We were so amazed about the customer service they provide to customers.

I had placed an order for 2 pumpkin pies and 1 cinnamon coffee cake for 3:30PM the next day.  I placed the order the night before on the website, since they stated they were not taking preorders far in advance.

Anyway, I work in the area so I got off of work to go and pick up the order, for our Thanksgiving get together.  I get in, I provide my order number that was provided in the email.  Then they gave me a number and asked me to wait, as per normal.  However, when my order was ""ready,"" they asked me to come up to the counter, and then I was told that there were ""no more pumpkin pies.""  To which I stated, I have a preorder, why was I not informed earlier about any problems with my order?  Granted, this is the night before Thanksgiving, so an early notice would have been appreciated since I would now somehow have to go and try to find a pumpkin pie for my Thanksgiving get together, at 4:00 PM.

The girl offered another cake or desert which I turned down because, it is Thanksgiving, and I need a pumpkin pie.  So then, she offers a refund, but I would not receieve it for 7-10 days.

Totally unacceptable.  If a preorder is made, then it should be honored.  If it cannot be honored, then the customer should be notified early.  I have been going to Porto's Bakery for years, this was my first time at the Northridge location, and I am extremely disappointed with the service or lack thereof that I got today.

I love the amount of seasonal products they have each season and that this location is closer to my home and university than the one in Burbank is. My only complaint is that if you have a large order in person or online, always make sure to double check each box of pastries/savories before you leave the building. This is not the first time this has happened to me before. On my birthday, I stopped by to buy a mango mousse cake and the charge on the receipt reflected this but when I got home there was a pineapple cake inside and I wasn't able to eat it bc I'm allergic to pineapple. Yesterday I had a large order (~$85) with many pasties and savories and one of my items (the mini pumpkin pie) was not included in the bag but I was still charged for it.

You hear it before you enter: the music transports you somewhere hopeful and spirited, a prelude to what awaits inside. It becomes an experience as you stroll through the front courtyard, far before you ever order anything, patrons seated left and right imbibing on coffee and orange juice or enjoying a platter of French toast and fruit. 
Sometimes, when opportunity presents itself and the stars align, we are able to enjoy a breakfast egg avocado sandwich sans children with minimal wait times in the morning. Other times, we order their chicken plato to go. It comes with a generous serving of chicken and a side of black beans, slow cooked and flavorful and steaming, along with golden plantains that are caramelized and tender and sweet. The accompanying rice is crack-- they must cook it in broth, because the rice could be a stand-alone dish, it's just so good. The side of lime is always dry for some reason, though the dish barely needs it. I appreciate this meal in particular for its consistent flavor profile, despite how many times I've ordered it. I always know I'm going to enjoy it.

Other solid favorites of mine include the 6 pack bolillos, housemade plantain chips, and potato balls. Don't skip their tres leches or seasonal pumpkin cheesecake.

You can't go wrong with their cheese and guava rolls but their flans and other desserts are equally glorious. 

When you come to the store, you won't miss the long lines and crowd that describe much any of the Porto stores anywhere. But essentially, the lines move very quickly cause they have many servers and staff who'll ask you what treats you want for the day. So, don't be intimidated by the lines, just look up at the boards and pick what you've been itching for to fill your tummy.

However, one that takes me back is their Platos Cubanos or plates, which to me is too salty. This is not to take away their excellent treats and sandwiches but if they can tame the ""saltiness"" of their platos, I will change my rating to 5. Don't get me wrong but I've been coming to Portos anywhere they're located, and have enjoyed most of their food. I hope that their.

If you haven't already had Porto's, please do yourself a favor, get your butt in there and order anything!! My (and most people's) favorite still has to be their famous potato balls! And I'm telling you from experience, don't just get one or two, get a couple for the road as well because you are going to be craving them after you're full. 

I've been to the Burbank location but today I came here and had to write a review at this one because in pretty sure it was twice as big as the Burbank one but the line moved even faster here. Everyone was very nice and they got their system down to where you get helped pretty quick. 

All of their desserts are so good and today I had something new from their cafe, the chicken milanesa sandwich ( mmmmmmmmmm!)

Staff: They're always friendly, welcoming, and helpful with each visit. They've taken my orders in person, and haven't had any issues. I've even had numerous friends do online orders, and have no issues at all, when it came to picking up, or having all items ordered complete, and in the bags.

Cleanliness: They have staff throughout the day cleaning the inside eating areas, as well as the outside eating areas. The numerous times I've visited this particular location it has always been clean. No complaints in this area.

Food/Drinks: By now you should know what thet offer to their customers. So many to choose from, from snacks/pastries, to full on entrée meals (Sandwiches), and tons of drink options.

For food, I ordered potato balls (MY FAVORITE), chicken croquets and a ham & cheese croissant. The food at Porto's always has a way of hitting the spot! For context, I went here for breakfast and it was very much needed to start my day out. The food is most definitely worth a try! 

The matcha latte was good, but I wish I asked what milk they used in the drink. The milk overpowered the flavor of the matcha and it washed it out. I think I just wanted more matcha flavor but it was still good enough to drink. I still want to give the strawberry matcha a try.

There is always a pretty long line, luckily this time I went the line wasn't out the door.

Make sure you get in the right line when you go inside.. there is a bakery line, and a Cafe line. 

You won't be able to see some prices until you're in line next to the display case. Although there is a big menu above for other goods like sandwiches and drinks. Also there are only deals for dozens, not half dozens if anyone is wondering. 

I'm happy they have vegetarian options now, I tried the corn croquettes, spicy cheese potato balls, and spinach and cheese empanadas.
These were all decent ~ I'd say a 3.5/5

Friends and family always go for the cheese rolls, chicken croquettes, and regular potato balls. Those are all 10/10.

I don't do ""heat.""  Finally, a couple of weeks ago around 4:00 pm on a weekday, there was only a line INSIDE, so we figured that was as good as it was going to get.  The line DOES move fast, so it was okay.

We only went for take out bakery items, which included some sweet and some savory.  I LOVE their potato and ground beef balls, and we tried their chicken croquettes, too, which I love even MORE than the potato balls !!!  OMG !!  I'm sorry we only bought 1 for each of us.  I can assure you that won't happen again !!  The chicken was in thickened bechamel sauce and then lightly fried to hold its shape.  PERFECTION.

We also bought a couple of pastries to try.  They have a lot of bread-type pastries, which are never my favorite, but with what I tried, the dough was very light, airy, and flaky, which I liked.  My favorite was their version of a cinnamon roll.  No sauce or icing on it, just lots of cinnamon flavor with very soft and airy dough.  Delicious.  I also really enjoyed their summer peach tart.  Fresh peach slices on top of vanilla cream in a tart shell.  Very tasty and refreshing especially on a hot summer day.

I don't know when we'll return, but we will.

"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""26/10/2023""",5,"While in California, an old friend suggested meeting at a fantastic Cuban bakery in Northridge. Another friend I was staying in Culver City immediately guessed it was Porto's. Being also a foodie, she raved about their grilled citrus chicken. Porto's in Northridge is a welcoming and popular space with both inside and outside seating. While the bakery had an awesome selection of treats, I followed her lead. Also called the Plato de Pollo (see pic), its Grilled Citrus Chicken breast was tender, flavorful and definitely memorable. The cilantro salsa verde was delicious - even for me who on occasion has not been a cilantro fan! Having lived in NYC area neighborhoods and eaten at many superb Cuban and Dominican restaurants, I can attest that their maduros (sweet fried plantains) were the best I've ever had! Savoring every bite, I cleaned my plate together with all the Cuban black beans and jasmine rice. On my next trip to Southern California, I'll head back to order it again and also leave room for one of their enticing pastries!","{""Friends"":10,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/iSnzRSKvRjVgbBi_IVGSdQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Harlem, New York, NY"",""Photos"":451,""Reviews_made"":136,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=oojGI4j-XMtsY9FyLNjxJA"",""Username"":""Mike R.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0Ebnn0Z5dhuaof9hOg3ugg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/N9l7SNU8_jEi__AedFn2Sw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",298,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Porto's Bakery and Cafe"

What would you like to eat in the morning with coffee? Dulce de leche cookies. What is good for an afternoon snack? Dulce de leche cookies. What should I nibble on before bed? Dulce de leche cookies. What am I craving after yoga/gym/running? Dulce de leche cookies. Porto's is a Los Angeles staple since 1976, renowned for its signature desserts in yellow boxes. Its popularity for exceptional quality desserts and Cuban food has spread to encompass 6 locations, with Northridge being the new-kid-on-the-block. I usually go to the Burbank location where parking is challenging and lines hug the buildings around the block. The Northridge location has a distinct strategic advantage because, unlike the original, it is LARGE. There are two separate lines (where you can order coffee/baked goods/sandwiches from) and an additional coffee line if you'd like to skip baked good and go straight for their dulce de leche latte. This location reminds me of going to Disneyland, where the lines are nice, organized, and long, with a treat awaiting you once you reach the end. There is plenty of seating, a large parking lot, and the same quality desserts you'd get at any of the other locations. Is it worth your visit? Dulce de leche cookies.

There were high top tables available by the window.  Plenty of seats outside, but we did not want to stay outside due to the hot and sunny weather. 

I ordered the lechon ($9) and it was very satisfying.  I would come here again because of the great value of the food portion and the quality you get compared to other restaurants in the area.

By the time we have finished, the were no lines. So I would definitely come back again but on a weekday after the rush hour.

We got a spinach feta empanada as a side ($1.20). It is phyllo dough stuffed with spinach and cheese. Yummm! Where else can you get a sandwich and aside for under $9. Great value.

Went in the evening to miss the lunch rush. There was plenty of parking because they are on a big open lot. When I walked in there was two lines one side for the cafe other side is for bakery. You can order whatever you want on either line but we were directed to the bakery side. The line moved quickly. 

The reason for the 4 stars: Brian who took our order took it on an iPad vs what everyone else was doing which was pen and paper. We asked for ice tea. He told us they don't sale it, but there was hibiscus tea instead, so we agreed. By the time we checked out per manager because iPad was used our order was messed up in the system.  The manager had to cancel and reorder everything twice. Which took an additional 10 mins. 

When everything was done and we went to pick up our food we looked at the beverage area and there was ice tea sitting there. We asked for extra cup because we wanted regular ice tea vs the hibiscus and they accommodated since it seemed worker wasn't that familiar with drinks that is offered.

Once you're inside they will direct you to the left or to the right to place your orders. You can order anything on either side. I ordered the ""Torrejas"" which is the Cuban style French toast, the ham, egg and cheese croissant sandwich, potato balls (a must) and the Dulce de Leche Latte. This was my first time trying all of those except for the potato balls. Everything was DELICIOUS!!! Would definitely order all items again on my next visit. Once you order and pay, they give you a number to place on your table and they bring you your food and drinks. There is plenty of seating indoor and outdoor.

My husband said his chicken sandwich was ok but not worth the wait in line. 

The pastries were great! I'm sad the server forgot my chocolate twist, but that's ok. I didn't need it. I got a strawberry pistachio tart and it was amazing! The guava cream cheese danish was tasty but I don't think I'd get another. I want to try everything else !!

"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""11/06/2022""",5,"So I'm a regular at their other locations and was jumping up and down when I heard they're opening closer to me in Northridge! Waited quite awhile for the actual opening and it surely did not disappoint!! The location is beautiful and modern, and big too! So far there's always a line to get in every time I visit, but I always buy at least a weeks worth of items, so it's worth the wait. Tasty and fresh, so many items to choose from! Both sweet and savory, just salivating as I'm writing and thinking about them! You can taste quality and not have to pay an arm and a leg here.

Once you get in front of the line to enter the bakery, they separate you into two lines in two separate sections. This is because they have two exact displays and cashiers for their bakery items. One on the left side of the store, and one on the right side of the store, both identical with the same items. They're just doing this to accommodate the large amount of customers. Once you get to actually order, you'll choose the items you want then they tell you to wait so they can pack it all up and have it ready for you to take home. Yes, more waiting, but if the end result is me chowing down on some yummy Porto treats for a whole week, then it's worth it! 

There's also a section that's for express order for their drinks and a few items of their pastries, so if you're not in need of their full menu or you just need to get a cup of coffee or cappuccino or latte, then head straight to that area so you don't have to wait in the long line for the bakery items. 

You can choose to dine in or takeout. The area to dine in looks beautiful, with modern atmosphere and it looks like it can accommodate a lot of people. Parking was easy every time I visited, but I can see how it can be hard when you come during busy times. You'll still get parking since it's in the same complex as the Northridge mall, but you may have to park a bit further away from the bakery. Service has always been friendly and super helpful. Never rushing you and always taking the time to explain things if you need to know what they are.

Hoping that the wait won't be so long as time passes by and the hype of their grand opening fades into normality. Then I'll come often for sure!","{""Friends"":36,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Ase8T4E3w5nFhcvUoaom5A/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Los Angeles, CA"",""Photos"":171,""Reviews_made"":171,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=G0a6l6RiYBpZygDSf5NiMw"",""Username"":""Laura J.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ucglOdUGXppKgtHYEPsLfw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/B8mwilPOTCdERSqy0Y9xmA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iQKTQL1Bq-iWs8pV_n-hsg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EKEsnFSVV1Y72-RRYNi5xg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BrnmsotK1-aj3ilUxd0jsg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/M0sM2EedTYjfsM-rfxs0Gg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/i0esnoBzYyTWdpTTyLQ0Ng/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3-eSHbRArybM_cKgtWFCig/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/H0kIoPo8As29YLUmwAsb6w/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7mhJssibQXlNLYADvh6jEQ/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",537,"","0 check-in","Porto's Bakery and Cafe"

They did not raise their prices despite the recent high rate of inflation. The quality has always been consistent and as expected from Porto's.

Today, they ran out of the pistachio strawberry tart and blueberry cheese croissant. I thought I scored when I saw them in the case at the coffee bar on my way out. The employee was nice enough to let me purchase it there, but...I found a fake eyelash in it when I ate it later!!

"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""06/07/2022""",5,"Perfection at it's finest!
It's pretty common to see a long line out the door at Porto's but this location has a seamless flow to keep the lines moving fast. You can order food, pastries and drinks from either the Bakery (left) or Cafe (right) stations. The food and drinks can take a while to get. Between the line and wait for your food, it's about 35 minutes (weekend morning). IT IS WORRH THE WAIT!Everyone is friendly, patient and work hard to get orders out.

Food: I had the guacamole omelette sandwich and it was so good I could have had two. I couldn't substitute for all egg white but I didn't mind. 

Coffee: I had the matcha and strawberry drink but I wasn't crazy about it. I also had a regular coffee and I liked it better. Very fresh bold taste. 

Bakery: The cheese roll and blueberry muffin were my  favorite. We took home a Tres Leche cake since that's what they're known for and our friends loved it. Everything we tried was delicious and light. It was so good that I ""accidentally"" forgot the plan was to split it with my girlfriend and I ate most of it (all). Hint: I recommend not sharing. 

Ambiance: The fun/chill Latin music gives it a very nice upbeat vibe and makes standing in line less dreading. There's an outdoor seating area, large indoor cafeteria like area and my favorite was the cozy sofa area. 

I've been to the Glendale location which was nice but this location deserves more than five stars. Great for kids and adults. I highly recommend!","{""Friends"":8,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/YZ5qWPah-r3u3zyxlnevXg/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Los Angeles, CA"",""Photos"":131,""Reviews_made"":116,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=SdHYBAUJPUg9zk2P2TMNew"",""Username"":""Huda K.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hAPjB8YNbvSTn1LVvcJh6w/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yjg-EqqwJxZEKZH-tGNYWQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5H2B1c-8x4ZL25VxLvkNYg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KAHFbioGsLydJYdb7zcZvQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ThtDEUdcnyFLhby8_l4OPw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7ggsGDLd3wo2DcdGQbwB-g/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qQ2qzg88p-nJX0bVWGLx7g/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d8u_BlJ9vgTqbAv9eMmTYA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gfuKBoXu-aNFjr9GJA8BAQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/L8Oj4jok5VPra0Nab1BOkQ/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",578,"","0 check-in","Porto's Bakery and Cafe"

I then went to my car to eat w my bf and as i was about to finish eating, a very small spider came out crawling the bread close to my face! Luckily my bf saw it and told me to stop eating and out of instinct i killed the spider and went back in right away to talk to the manager. I was so freaked out thinking what if i already ate some of the spiders!? Unfortunately since i was so freaked out they took the box w the rest of my sandwich and i wasn't able to take a picture for proof. They just gave me a full refund and told me that if i ever visit back again, I just need to talk to one of the managers on duty and show my receipt to get an on the house order of anything i want.

I was surprised how quickly the line moved but quickly figured out why as I made it inside the building and saw how efficiently they had everything running.  The best part of the experience came from the girl that took my order. After reading off to her a list of items I had written down, I asked her what her personal favorite item was. She said something which I didn't quite catch, but told me to wait at the cash register for my order. I was taken aback when she came back out with a bag with what she said was her favorite item. I was a little caught off guard so I don't think I was able to show my appreciation as much as I would have liked. But that little gesture alone made my thanksgiving day. On top of that, everyone in my family really loved all the items I brought back that day (potato balls, chicken croquette, spinach empanada, raspberry orange scone, chocolate and butter croissants, strawberry matcha).

I couldn't believe that Porto's, a mega-hit bakery that's popular ALL over Los Angeles, with such an obviously large kitchen & staff could not have the selection that I've seen in Glendale & Burbank. But we went in today for breakfast and there were about 10 other customers which made the HUGE dining rooms seem so empty. It seems to me that business is just not as good as they expected and are not able to produce all the goodies needed to fully stock their shelves, which is sad. I HOPE business picks up, which it should with all the apartments being built in this area. So we purchased a breakfast burrito, a breakfast sandwich, large coffee, 8 large cookies & 2 scones... for $27. Pretty good bargain. Yes, I wish they had a bigger selection of coffee appropriate cookies (crispy dip able ones)!!!

You should really allow just the cake line like other Porto's.","{""Friends"":88,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/oH2h2SCw-Mhz-Vto5UMQrw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Granada Hills, Los Angeles, CA"",""Photos"":637,""Reviews_made"":122,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=i7mveXNZ5hbkqkjy5-rAJQ"",""Username"":""Laura P.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vMPRFOppzSuWn2x_qohHQA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d7FXuvbxBrql04NEibYVbA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/E_Uo3eylCTBXjvRkXEtQnA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MNe_w2vk96JQcsFD-5vHWQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jOIhJMaVmUQbss_ct4GM3w/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bD4GUs--MZz2rvf4rDDZvg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZlTbACZXUiP_1RSETbE8YQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iGHXzrA1hOkzjDf7LSqiOw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/x3qWgxh2pWGoCWyOHtTSnw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SJlBKYivgYABpcyrf1X_oA/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Love and so happy that Porto's opened in Northridge.

"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""10/11/2022""",5,"Yum Yum Yum. I can't get enough of Portos. I'm so glad I don't live so close to this one or else I would be fat already. I love everything and I've never had anything I don't like from here. My favorites are the potato balls, The cheese pastries, the guava and cheese, the apple pastries, the meat pies, the chicken croquettes, and the chocolate chip cookies. This time I also tried the Besito cookies. Those were also quite delicious and I had dolce de Leche and the chocolate. I'm telling you everything is good here. It is best if you have a large order to order ahead of time online. I ordered about 120 things for my party. I ordered it online the same day in the morning at about seven or 8 AM. Then I was able to pick it up at around 11 AM. The order was ready and I skipped the line. The line was out of the door and around the corner. The online ordering skips this giant line as well. So I would definitely suggest using that online ordering. You have to order the same day you can't order the day before so you must get up early to get the online ordering. But if you don't and you're in line, the line goes kind of quickly so it shouldn't take too long because they have lots of staff. They also have cakes here. They also have sandwiches and other things to drink but I haven't tried them. Their empanadas are also good. Their prices are excellent with each pastry being between 1 to 2 dollars. Some of the more fancy desserts are about three dollars.","{""Friends"":450,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/kaspsJ7y_l5fzBlfc6iO-Q/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""San Fernando Valley, CA"",""Photos"":1770,""Reviews_made"":340,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=rX3td1as6p5AWhCqXsISXg"",""Username"":""Teri K.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8G8JJXW3rKz7UJmEvajzIQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xmcLm7a-vSJSNsn21Rvh7Q/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":4,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Hi Teri, \n\nThank you for this great review!

"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""22/06/2022""",5,"I'm so excited about this new location! The building is huge and there's SO much parking, which is a huge bonus. One of the major things holding me back from visiting Portos in the past was having to fight for parking. 

I ordered online for pickup, which was really convenient. You can head straight to the front of the line at the door and they'll direct you to the area to pick up your order. They only allow same-day orders online and time slots will close as they fill up (however the time slots at this location didn't fill up as quickly compared to some of the other locations). 

Visiting Portos kind of reminds me of Disneyland; organized chaos! The prices are so reasonable, and the baked goods are delicious. I love the cheese rolls, guava and cheese strudels, and cheese and spicy pepper potato balls. Pro tip: heat up leftovers in the air fryer and they'll taste fresh. Everything is very reasonably priced, and I'm really happy there is a much more convenient location. 

If you're picking up an online order, make sure you have everything before driving off like me! I woke up the next morning and realized I had some missing items, but I filled out a form online and I was contacted within a couple hours.

"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""08/01/2023""",4,"Finally got around to trying this place after waiting for the initial craze to die down a bit. I have only ever eaten desserts and potato balls from here and always at parties so not actually even at the location. Today my husband and I went for breakfast and it was BUSY. We got there around 9:30am and the indoor dining areas were packed. So keep in mind maybe having someone scout out a table while someone else orders. It's a bit chaotic in there for me but they do their best to get things moving as quickly and smooth as possible. I highly recommend knowing what you're going to order before you get to the front as well. We got a couple chicken empanadas, a meat pie and some croissant sandwiches. As for drinks my husband got freshly squeezed orange juice and I tried the Dulce de leche latte on ice. Whatever pastries/baked goods are behind the counter you get right away and then you have to wait for your drinks and food to be brought to your table. Things seem to come from different kitchens. Also if you get stuff from the bakery it's not warm; our empanadas and meat pie where COLD. Other than the food was good. Again if you aren't knowledgeable on the menu maybe read it beforehand as it's busy there is a sense of urgency to order once you're at the counter. There is outdoor dining and plenty of parking so at least that's not an issue.","{""Friends"":196,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/CXXUO80xzN0hLJZhr0jMtw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Los Angeles, CA"",""Photos"":888,""Reviews_made"":280,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=tYohG8vN3esOT_cyabyN5w"",""Username"":""Allie G.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_j5X7DD6IAHN_1j30Ldy4w/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QXD6VTxTMis9tV4gCgYPpQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CMdfLm6K3HLrr92dZJmB3Q/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",568,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Porto's Bakery and Cafe"

They have some gourmet stuff for the 90's prices. The menu is pretty much cafe style and you get breakfast options plus salads , sandwiches and soups apart from the bakery stuff.

We got Mocha late and dulce de leches latte and those were quite good as well .

My go to is Burbank but the Northridge location is closer to me. Came into today for 2 chicken milanesa sandwiches, 2 chicken croquettes, and 2 chicken empanadas. Right when we were about to pay we were told that they were out of chicken croquettes. Next we were told they were out of chicken milanesa sandwiches. So pretty much out of most of our order. Cashier Kent was very knowledgeable and helped us pick other choices but we were still a bit disappointed that the most of the items we came for were out and we were only notified when paying. 
We talked to the manager Kevin and our issue was not resolved. It actually made us more frustrated. We told him that they should let us know while ordering what they're out of instead while paying. He then told us that the croquettes were now done being fried and we could go back to the register and purchase them. As for the sandwiches his option was for us to wait 30 minutes for the bread to be able to be pressed. We already changed our entire order up and paid for it. If we would've known it was only going to be a couple of minutes for the croquettes then we would've waited for it since we still had to wait for our other food. Instead of offering us croquettes on the house for the inconvenience and horrible miscommunication it was you guys can now go back to the register and purchase them.

I walked away and looked in the window at the coffee bar to see how long the line was there and guess what?  NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN THE LINE (SEE PICTURE). I don't get any sandwiches or other food ever.  But I wasn't allowed to go order my one coffee at the coffee bar without waiting in the long line in the rain outside. I called the store to try and ask a manager if this was a new policy; because if it is, I'm never coming here again.  I waited on hold for 20 minutes and when they finally answered I asked the girl on the phone to talk to a manager and she said that they aren't allowed to put managers on the phone.

"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""22/04/2022""",5,"Porto's is finally in Northridge! I had planned to come here when it opened on Tuesday, but drove passed and decided not to when I saw the crazy line outside. I made plans to come early in the morning on Saturday instead (like the usual Burbank Porto's routine to stand in line to secure my cheese rolls haha). Well, that didn't go as planned since I ended up oversleeping and ended up heading over to Porto's at around 12 pm instead. I was really expecting the worst but was surprised to find that although there was still a line outside, my total wait time was probably less than 25 minutes. Going inside, it made sense why the wait time was so fast. The line gets split into about 3 or 4 different stations, 1 station for whole cakes, 1 station for the cafe (just drinks perhaps?), and 2 stations for the usual stuff (cheese rolls, potato balls, and breakfast/lunch options). The workers and servers are working so efficiently, it was really impressive!

My boyfriend was concerned they would sell out of cheese rolls since it was a weekend but when we asked, the workers confidently responded they had more than enough supply for this kind of crowd. We ended up ordering 2 dozen cheese rolls and 1 dozen potato balls to bring back to our families, and to complete the experience, we also ordered food to eat there. The cheese rolls and potato balls were put into the iconic large yellow boxes and bagged up, and we were given a tracker and informed we could sit anywhere and they would bring us our food (Awesome because I had only ever seen those beeping machines that tell you when your order is ready and you have to go and pick it up at a window). There is a plethora seating options, from a little cubby a cute little waiting cubby near the front, large indoor AND outdoor dining areas, as well as tables for 2 lining the edge of the store. It feels like all the space was carefully planned to be the most efficient as possible. 

They were sold out of their almond croissants so I ordered a blueberry tart (name?) instead along with a mocha latte, and my boyfriend ordered a pan con lechon (slow-roasted pork sandwich) with a blended mocha. We also shared a slice of parisian cake. Our server found us swiftly and dropped off our food. As expected of the quality at Porto's, I had an excellent meal. I was concerned the blueberry tart (?) would be too sweet as they often are in bakeries, but I found the blueberries were naturally sweet and the pastry portion was perfectly fluffy, flaky, and complemented the blueberry and cream cheese center well. Both the mocha latte and the blended mocha were true to the mocha flavors, not to sweet and not too bitter (unlike Starbucks mocha lol). The real star of the show was the pan con lechon, though! I still have thoughts about this sandwich. The meat was juicy, the bread was perfectly warmed and toasted, and the FERMENTED ONIONS!! Amazing. Immaculate. The sandwich even comes with a couple fried plantains which were a nice little crunchy side. Lastly, as for the parisian cake, I thought it was a good level of sweetness for all that chocolate. My boyfriend says this cake is his favorite of all time, so I actually didn't expect to like it lol since he has such a great sweet tooth, but the cake ended up being so moist and not overly sweet, that I understood why he liked it so much. 

I'm not too sure if in a couple weeks, the crowds will die down since we've seen lines outside of the Burbank location forever. However, I do feel this Porto's is a well-oiled machine. They have been trained for these kinds of crowds and while the physical line can be long, the wait times are short, and the food is always delicious!","{""Friends"":227,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/e3WSnqM_w5VqISWa0dTuVA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Burbank, CA"",""Photos"":255,""Reviews_made"":108,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=zzYks_tVs-eXkWfGZAZRbQ"",""Username"":""Demi F.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/f9TyydSPLeqAaHz9Kthtcg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/W8HGvTIO9GSdxGhVanFeYA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Fc3C_KkngnB45dI7hA6YTQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4cL4wfUqT8xCaEoBBDINkg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/e6oTxHkVInbY_pLBsp_9FA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J6ZAhaByS-yCnw6Kdo4s9A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tQSMhs0fgKPsIafFXz3cOw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":4,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",742,"","0 check-in","Porto's Bakery and Cafe"

We got here like around 9:45am and they weren't that many people where there would be a line outside. My wife got like 3 boxes of bakery food and I just got a grilled chicken sandwich. They told me that they couldn't put in the order yet because the chicken sandwich starts at 10am. So they told me to pick up the order first and then pay after. To avoid any issues because I experience some and had to talk to a manager to get my grilled chicken just wait for it to be 10am. The store is well kept and the employees are all helpful. If you're planning on eating there then just come early because a lot of people dine outside unless  you don't mind sitting in the sun. The parking situation over here is okay because it's in a mall plaza so there a lot of spots to pick from. I think when they allow drive up pickup then it would make things even more efficient but I'm pretty sure they are still working out the logistics for this.","{""Friends"":90,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/QMykQHtkOF_E-Kkrqk8Cqw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Los Angeles, CA"",""Photos"":15459,""Reviews_made"":1229,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=7hzeRBtVuTqDSw23BAV_qA"",""Username"":""Peter X.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/03tFIgOp_8b6AivAZk3hjw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XYnY_fMiVS3adXsTIlW6DA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/p2Ue6sZUlF9Q9QcAbOuD7A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/qNqp69BZDTHdAfsJ2ByRKA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xfsi8r2HoaNLiza9_kKZ4g/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bCIB4qakyGmrg9XAV84XmA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8u5w8e8ok9YVYh_R5TyQCQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uV_ZbIzM--HYpTH6b0q9Ig/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dXekaysfzxGNoOhFcBfbXA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/689BPsDuVqRqSUY2FkQdEA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/njAp0JEWGWP7hwHTbPEb7Q/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UuR1CBY2AnSx3tcfq6tpqg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nWd_5kjNxhp39ZBrpOZNhg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ygd-eraC2PiFveUR1s9Eeg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Yt-0dsFSuMRfJpqTgGjxew/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6cA32nARmj8kmnfn3BkKNw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CeD4yKkjbiRXy_ogvZSOzw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3We5yYeWPYr58qTXcBER4w/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4bpep19PzMdv7Q4gm2D1Yg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RaGcVUHTxNACaoGc9u4_KA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iEZ7LXCgjWG4rrN78hzugQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nWJgJoU5ScFcI4FwnxVfog/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Uycj3VF_T7tzUv2P9e13pg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4eW-frMAyys1KBn_p0WtPg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xwylkc61rqnq2ivJpqzUNg/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",750,"Elite from 24","15 check-in","Porto's Bakery and Cafe"

After a few minutes, someone said they'd be just a moment. A line built up behind me but after a few more minutes, no one still came up to help us. Someone was bagging another order and I asked if anyone would be helping us or if anyone was handling the online check-in line and the employee with braids had an attitude about how it would be just a moment. I told her, that's what someone said five minutes ago but OK.

Not more than a minute later, someone came to address the line and I got my order. (A whole other employee) When I got home, they packed the right cake but didn't provide the happy birthday plaque that I ordered! 

What shitty service. I know it's busy but the bakery has been open for months with a steady high volume in customers. The amount of customers isn't something new. I've frequented the Glendale and Burbank locations with no issues like this and this was my first time going to the Northridge location. I don't need your attitude from your employees when no one really acknowledges people in line waiting to check-in to pick up their orders on time. So many employees walked by and no one thought to confirm that there really would be help in just a moment???

Only the girl with the eyeliner mentioned something but she stepped away for more than a moment and then miss braids had to have an attitude when I followed up.

The food is tasty, the portions are good, the prices are very fair. I do think that management may have to set a time limit as to how long people can sit there for once they're done with their food. We were there at about 2:00 o'clock and notices that the majority of the people around Us were done eating but, still stayed for the hour that we were there.

He then chuckled at me and walked away. I figured he didn't want to clean up the table because he might be busy with something else but I just see him chatting it up with his other co workers which did not make the situation better. I believe his name was chris, he was a short latino young man and has short hair. The table never got cleaned up so I ended up getting my food to-go.

The new place is exquisite and very big, it's beautiful to look at and it's nice to be in there. However the only downside is that it is sort of confusing as to how it works once you get inside. It seems like there are two ordering counters but I'm not sure if you can choose from the whole menu at them. There are 'stations' like the cakes stations and the drinks/coffee, and that was confusing, they just told us to order at one of them so we did. I wish the workers would explain to you before you come in. 

The lady who helped me out though was very kind and answered all my questions, and wasn't annoyed when I added another item once my order was initially done. Food came out fast as well and yeah, everything's delicious and high quality. I wish they had the 3 leches cake cups but it seems they don't.

I went on the second day of their opening and although the line is super long as expected, everything was super organized and well prepared. Line moves quite quickly and service is super efficient.

I do have to add that the location in Burbank off Magnolia is great because they have the drinks centrally located, and they also have another area for drinks in another seating area.

"portos-bakery-and-cafe-northridge","""23/06/2022""",3,"The newest Portos location is nice, new and huge. Big place and lots of outdoor dining as well (didn't see too much indoor dining though). There was a guy standing in the front directing people to which line to go to. There seemed to be only 2 lines - one for the bakery and one for the café. I guess there was also a cake pick up area as well as the area to pick up drinks also. The line moved well. But I think I still waiting over 20 minutes to order. My order also took awhile to put together. It looked like Miguel, who was my helper, was also training a new staff member. I'm all for training people and understand the need for it. Just not sure they had any kind of urgency to getting the order together. Miguel was working and explaining things but the trainee seemed to just be listening instead of pitching in to help. I saw many people getting their orders and paying while I stood there waiting. I also ordered tamales, which is probably why the order took awhile to put together. It turned out they didn't even have enough tamales to fill my entire order. And Miguel only mentioned it after he gave the order to the cashier to enter in. There was a quick apology but no other options. Could I have waited for more tamales, was that an option? Could I have been offered to get something else instead of those tamales I wanted? I think it just could've been handled a little better. Anyways I got an assortment - potato balls, cheese rolls, guava cheese strudels, meat pies, besito cookies, cinnamon citrus buns, mango mousses, fruit tarts and the strawberry pistachio tart. In addition to my only 4 tamales and I also tried the cinnamon coffee cake. The coffee cake is whole ring of a cake for $9. Great for breakfast - my huubby did wish there was more cinnamon in it. You can't go wrong with the cheese rolls, potato balls and guava cheese strudels - those are solid. My new favorite as of late are the cinnamon citrus buns. It's like a mix of a croissant and muffin with citrus streusel on top. So good. Used to be a lot more affordable but with inflation, it's getting up there in price. Luckily this is a once in awhile place.

I used to love trying something different each time I went but I'm pretty sure that there are tons of product that they no longer offer anymore.

This is our receipt which when we got home we did not receive. We asked and ordered 3 guava and cheese and 3 guava. Once we got home realised this is not what we received or what was on the receipt. The lady even read that back to us. So that's the first fk up.
Open the box to find a dozen cheese rolls PLUS 6 more cheese rolls. Not one guava....... There's so many cheese rolls two people can eat. So already lost a tiny bit of money.
Secondly NOTHING WAS FRESH. The baguette was stale and hard like inedible. The cheese rolls were dry and bland. Only received 4 potato balls not even the ones we ordered. Like how can you mess up so badly. They charged us extra for almond milk then a staff member came over and said it was included and then proceeds to bring a side of vanilla I guess to make up for it which is so pathetic. The tres leches cake had finger holes in it like how can you ruin a beautiful cake like that.

"texas-premier-coat-resurfacing-austin","""22/09/2016""",5,"What a fantastic experience! I originally was considering having a flagstone overlay added to my back patio. I got a quote from a different company that made flagstone seem like an unattainable fantasy, due to the high cost. Fast forward 10 months later. I stumbled across an add with a coupon for Texas Premier Coat Resurfacing. I called, and Bret (the owner) came out promptly and gave me an estimate that was much more affordable than the flagstone quote I had received. I figured I'd go ahead and give it a try. Best! Decision! Ever! We had the overlay installed on our back patio, around the base of our wooden patio and pergola columns, and on our front patio and walkway. It looks so beautiful! Alberto came out and worked with me to find the perfect color scheme. Alberto is truly an artist... He created the exact look I was hoping for! The final product looks even better than real flagstone, in my opinion. The customer service is also top notch! Bret was super responsive to my many calls, texts and emails and was always available to answer my questions. If you're looking for flagstone, don't bother... Go with these guys instead.

"texas-deck-pros-san-antonio","""18/07/2023""",2,"In January, I researched several companies to complete the installation of a patio on my new home. I wanted to design a composite deck that would stand the test of the years, and found two companies in San Antonio offering the installation services I required.

After reviewing the company's website, I decided to go with Texas Remodeling Pros as I did like the photos of the work they had recently completed. Their salesman Michael arrived to my home and assessed the size of the upcoming operation. It seemed like a fairly easy process to design and Michael and I discussed my  payment options.

I consider myself intelligent and am not trying to be ignorant or obtuse about how Michael and I discussed what payment options were available and how I could lower the price.  As a veteran, Michael offered me a veteran's discount that took the price down from $11,366 to $9,093.  He then stated that if I paid in Cash, I could save an additional savings that would bring my total down to $8525 if I didn't use my Credit Card.

I jumped at the opportunity to save more as the company offered financing, credit cards and a payment of a check as a way to pay.  Last week, I made my first deposit from my bank account where the money was debited from my checking's account. When the final payment was requested of $4500 yesterday, I questioned Evan as to why I wasn't given my Cash discount because I paid the money from the cash out of my checking's account.

She began to speak quickly about me not paying ""All Cash"" for my deposit.  She stated arrangements were not made to come and pick up the cash from my home.  I quickly informed her that no one from Texas Remodeling Pros informed me that they needed to come and pick up CASH from my home for me to get the required Cash Discount. I was quite upset that I felt I was deceived a bit and wanted my discount .

Because she had to leave for the day, I did not want to argue back and forth with Evan. I have never had a company require me to pay ""All Cash"" for a discount, especially when I didn't use my credit card for my initial payment.

I write this review so that any other customer seeing an ""All Cash discount"" is not bamboozled like I felt I was yesterday.

While I enjoy looking at my patio, I didn't enjoy the trash the workers left on my property while they were working.  I did reach out to the company and they did rectify the issue immediately, but they should encourage their vendors to respect a customer's home at all times. 

Also, I would highly recommend getting multiple bids when utilizing this company.  I also considered them for my front circle driveway, but quickly dropped them from the running after a 115K bid was presented to me.  I even informed Michael that I had 3 Bids in the 40's and he stated that he was the best... (Yeah OK...) didn't go with them.... 

While it's cute, nothing about the patio screams $9000, especially with the few materials that were delivered to complete the construction.

All in all, I just recommend you question everything they say and look at the fine details of your contract. Due to interactions during the payment process, I can't recommend at this time .","{""Friends"":720,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/fDRuPoN_H_j5TWBjPmkyNA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""San Antonio, TX"",""Photos"":1817,""Reviews_made"":269,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=lD--fslfnDeAhoDH_f1zMQ"",""Username"":""Jacqueline J.""}","null","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",2,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Texas Deck Pros"

"burgess-services-san-antonio","""28/07/2020""",5,"Looks like I'm the first to review Burgess, so huzzah! I have a home that needs a little love and TLC. Probably more than a little if I'm being honest. Some things I can do, some I can't. The retaining wall in my back yard was in sad shape. The wife and I are seriously considering moving in the next year, or so, and thought replacing it would be a simple summer project.  When researching the type and cost of materials, pricing out some tools I'd have to buy etc... I realized the cost was going to be much more than I originally thought. At this point I decided to look into hiring someone that actually had experience doing this since the cost was getting comparable of me doing it vs a pro.

This is where I turned to Yelp to find contractors that could give me an estimate. Of the three I was put in touch with, Burgess was by far the most responsive. They came out (I believe the next day) to discuss the project, see what my expectations were and give me their estimate. 

Now keep in mind, I rely heavily on customer reviews when doing most anything online and Burgess had 0 reviews on Yelp. I was a bit apprehensive initially but felt much more comfortable after talking with Devin (and I think his wife). Watching them work gave me a solid impression of their competence and I felt this would be a good company to do business with. 

While looking into replacing the retaining wall I was simultaneously going through an agonizingly slow process of working through an insurance claim to fix the foundation of the house which had been damaged due to some leaks under the slab. Once Devin have me his quote for the wall I told him I was going to have to wait until I knew what the insurance company determined my out of pocket expenses would be for the foundation. The quote Burgess gave me was more than it would have cost me to do the job myself, obviously, but still very reasonable. 

Eventually, insurance finished what they needed to do (a month after I initially reached out for quotes) and I let Devin know I was ready to move forward with Burgess replacing the retaining wall. After a brief delay due to weather, they came out and completed the job in one day when it was initially expected to take two (he pulled some extra help from jobs that were still to wet to be worked on).

Devin was extremely flexible on scheduling and the price. I had a very easy time communicating, mostly via text messaging. They're a local, family owned business and made the entire process as smooth as possible. Although I don't see myself needing the services of a landscaping company very often in my future, Burgess will definitely be the people I turn to first when I do!","{""Friends"":0,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/ZQNU1q6YSorH1tlrQ2lCyg/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""San Antonio, TX"",""Photos"":16,""Reviews_made"":9,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=YXP_XuUoYXwc3Z7t0WLnJQ"",""Username"":""Paul P.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SrYIJ3zAygMI8lMasXfN6A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WkLGb72ZoTWxE_IeZOS5kg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/V7cyTzSm5Wpobwls4upDWw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/W6r7z1dqwOw3bCqAbO8IPw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PHPpCV2yoTLOo0WZRTaA5A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zFTe-nMM3Miw6esPCous1A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hYB3TG_zQ8wMSK6eY9QYVQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Y-WgbYkaJVrEH5gRccGxLQ/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",13,"","0 check-in","Burgess Services"

We are saddened at your review…in addition, disheartening to read a defamatory review. In the text messages you have provided it is clear how consistent our communication was with you despite our vehicle being caught on fire - with proof of a police report, arson investigator and photos / videos at the time of the scene. We would have preferred this be an excuse.. unfortunately, we did not have a vehicle for travel and/or transportation of material (which was communicated, you were made aware and acknowledged a later start date.) In the text messages you voluntarily have attached and provided - you willingly offered a “delayed” start due to weather. Our delays, if any, were due to severe weather conditions in November & December, which would have been near impossible to break ground in. As weather conditions continued to escalate, it was clear breaking ground was going to continue being pushed back, so we offered a full refund. Our agreed refund timeline was February 15. On February 14, a text message you left out of this review, said: \n\n“Hi Riley! Are you available to pick up and/or have me deliver payment this week? Our Venmo is still down due to too many “cards” added last year. The “flag” is lifted in a few weeks. Same with zelle as we transfer accounts to a new bank. I’m more than happy to deliver or have you pick up in the San Antonio area! Lmk what works best for you. Thanks.”\n\nYou responded: \n\n“Hi! Thanks for texting. I prefer a money order mailed to me with tracking. Please let me know if you need my mailing address.” \n\nWe had payment ready for you the day prior to the agreed refunded timeline. You were made aware we had to accommodate extra travel and time allotted to us depositing & withdrawing a money order. We again, communicated our updated eta on this. Your response: “That’ll be great.” \n\nAnother text that was left out of this review on February 17: \n\n“Hey Riley! Thanks for checking in. And my apologies for the delay… I’ll be finalizing things Monday at bank, I can send over night Tuesday / Wednesday for arrival by Friday. Or again, I really don’t have a problem dropping off. Please let me know which you’d prefer”\n\nA second attempt at delivering a refunded payment, again, you were made aware and kindly understood the updated eta. We finally got our Venmo updated and running - Venmo does in fact lock you out for 6 months if too many cards are added to an account. This information is public and verifiable. Our “6th month” of this unfortunate flag being lifted, was in fact February…as communicated in previous exchange. \n\nWe enjoyed working for you our first time around. You experienced our quality, respect, morals & attention to detail. We understand your frustration - however, it was an unfortunate time with weather conditions and a vehicle that was sadly caught on fire. We are saddened at this review as you have received a full, not partial, refund weeks ago. Your response to our refund was “I received it. Thanks for sending it.” We never lost communication with you, we kept consistency and most importantly kept our word in providing you a refunded payment.

1. He postponed starting date numerous times.  The actual starting date was 30 days after the date he first told me.
2. He left the job incomplete and in shoddy quality.  His crew started on 11/29/2023.  It's a 4-5 days job, but they didn't work continuously.  After their last show-up on 12/11, they never came back to complete the work.
3. He didn't do the job according to contract terms.  I had to remind him and his crew multiple times the footer need to be 2 feet deep.
4. He ignored my multiple inquiries and reminders about installing drainage according to contract, and insisted on pouring concrete without leaving spaces for drainage pipes and backfilling.
5. The concrete wall he poured was not vertically straight.  It's leaning outwards, and won't last its purpose of retaining.
6. He has pressured me to make payment all the time, and threatened to drop the job.
7. After I confronted him that he must fulfill the terms of contract to install drainage, he refused to come back unless I make more payment.

I've paid him 50%, and he left me a shoddy mess.  He refuses to come back to see what his crew has done, unless I pay him more.

"perma-pier-foundation-repair-of-texas-san-antonio","""03/07/2021""",1,"Perma-Pier repaired our foundation one year ago.  During this repair, the sewer line also had to be replaced by a plumber, which is expected, because raising the foundation will break the sewer line if not damaged already from the settling.  I chose perma-pier for their lifetime warranty.  

Unfortunately, one year later the foundation already had begun to sink causing cracks in our walls and problems with the new flooring we had installed.  A lifetime warranty only covers the foundation, not any other subsequent damage resulting from faulty foundation work.   I have to replace the flooring and repair the cracks in the walls at my expense, a second time. Perma-pier did promptly raise the foundation again. 

This second time, during their repair, they broke the water lines which are much more difficult and expensive to repair than the sewer line.  This is specifically excluded from their warranty.  They either did not notice or just didn't report it.    Within a couple of weeks the back yard was soaked in water.  Again, the water line is my problem, not covered by warranty.  This may cost me another $6,000.00 or so, depending how much digging under the house has to be done to find the leak under our house. 

I'd rather have a short or no warranty at all than a warranty with a company who can't get it right the first time.

His price was in line with one other bid I received and approximately $1100 less than a bid I got from another mason in Liberty Hill.  Day 1 was mostly staging gear and delivering materials.  About 3 rows of stone were laid that day.  Day two was a long, full day of hard work by Tony, the lead mason who was a true professional.  Much of the day was spent dodging thunderstorms and lightning.  As a result the work spilled over into a short third day with work finishing around 11am.  I could not be happier with the results.  The stonework is excellent with pleasing lines and consistent mortar lines.  Stone and brick edges are straight and smooth.  My job called for one row of bricks at the top as an accent and this work required some special cuts to look pleasing.  Jaye Stark, the owner, did most of the brick work.  He is a true craftsman.  There were four men who worked on my project.  All were friendly and very good at their work.  Solid teamwork was evident throughout the project.

We called CRC and Neale came out and took a look at our problem. He was very knowledgeable and friendly, and helped explain what was happening to cause it to sink, and explained his proposed solution. He got us a quote in a few days, and we scheduled for about a month later, because of the holidays. Neale's crew showed up on time and got to work right away. They drilled small holes into the driveway and used foam to Jack the slabs up to the right height. Then, another crew came in and took out all the wood in between the slabs, and filled it in with a polyurethane sealer (this was at Neale's recommendation, because it would help prevent any future issues of erosion underneath the slabs). The crew were very clear with the instructions - no driving on the driveway for a couple of days because of that new sealer.

"allens-foundation-solutions-boerne-3","""23/05/2013""",1,"Bought my first home and unfortunately this company did an 11K plumbing/drainage repair on the home for the prior owner weeks before we purchased.  Had to call them for necessary paperwork regarding a hydrostatic test for my foundation warranty.  (PermaPier who had repaired the foundation only had the original hydrostatic test where the house failed.)  So today I called them to secure any sort of evidence that the drainage system on the house had passed.  1st they told me they didn't have a record of that.  Then the woman who answered the phone started saying, ""We didn't fail anything.""  Baffling.  After 20 minutes of talking in circles, I realized I had entered the Twilight Zone.  Finally, after repeating myself in five different ways they started talking about a green piece of paper.   And yes, this is what I was asking for.  Hope grew in me.  The contractor, who had been yelling in the background throughout the conversation, decided the plumber they contracted had ""the green slip"" and that they would get it for me.  I was getting closer!!!!  Then they called back 5 min later and gave me the general phone number to the city of San Antonio?  wth?  This is when I lost it.  The reason this company was hired was b/c of a failed hydrostatic test.  Wouldn't you think they would have a copy of evidence that the house drainage now passes?  Truly one of the worst and weirdest customer service experiences of my life.  

With regards to the work they did so far I have to dig out an entire side of my house b/c they placed a pipe so shallow that there is now dirt piled up onto the siding of my house.  In Texas that is a termite risk.  If the pipe had been dug to a correct depth the dirt would cover the slab foundation only i.e. no termite risk.

"advanced-concrete-designs-san-antonio-2","""29/10/2023""",1,"My wife and I just bought a home in April of this year and decided to have some updates done to the property. One of the first things we decided to do was extend our concrete patio to cover a dirt patch. We looked online and found Advanced Concrete, and after seeing mostly good reviews decided to hire him. We got scheduled for the work and ended up liking the results. The only issue we had with this work is that they dumped concrete waste in the back corner of our backyard.

We have multiple dogs and had been looking for the best solutions to keep the floor clean and manageable. After looking at the possibilities, we decided that stained concrete floors would be the best option. Having already used this company for the patio, we decided to retain their services and get all our floors replaced (we had a mixture of floor types). We got scheduled and were told it would take an estimated 7 days to complete as well as haul off the concrete from the backyard. Now, I understand an estimate is an ESTIMATE. However after a week had gone by watching them on our security cameras come in after 10am and leave by 2pm, we were told that they needed more time. At this point in time, the old floors were not all the way up and there was a big pile of trash in the living room. We gave them more time as there wasn't really anything we could do about it. I eventually was able to come in during the day to find out what the issue was. The contractor assured us that they would get the trash out asap as well as work overnight to stay on the new time frame (in total it took 2 weeks with weekends). We got a call Friday after work that the AC isn't working and it's too humid for the concrete to dry properly, although they already began to lay the floors. I rushed over to find out not only had they not ventilated like they said they would but-
This was not the first day they AC wasn't working. After looking at our smart AC information it was running over 18 hrs for 3 days in a row with it set at 80 degrees.
The AC filter was so packed with dust from them not ventilating that dust poured off. They never informed us that a new AC filter was needed.
They had also tried to set the AC to 70 degrees one day but we caught that and had that corrected.

After finally being done with the floors we came home to-
Tape everywhere
100's of nails sticking out where they removed baseboards
Dust everywhere
Floor stain on walls
Old baseboards with nails sticking out in backyard 
And the backyard concrete STILL THERE after they assured they would clean that up from when they did the patio work

The main area that needed work was the entryway that was built up on subfloor and was beginning to crack. After a couple of visits on recurring weekends, they poured concrete and patched it to the rest of the concrete (additional work we paid for). However, it looks horrible and the contractor knows it. While they were patching I pointed out they still haven't gotten the backyard concrete, to which he replied ""Yes we did"" and ""We don't have a trailer to haul anything else, but we'll get it next weekend"". The next weekend it was ""Yes we did"" and ""We don't have shovels"". I provided them shovels and they filled up a wheelbarrow full of concrete. We have a lock and camera on the gate/backyard so they NEVER got anything before that.

Additionally, on multiple occasions I overheard the laborers insulting us as well as calling my wife a b**** (they never met her). The contractor is nice in person, but his work is backed up by shotty performance and subpar results.  

Minutes after the last time they left, I noticed a spot that was missed. He told me they used all of the concrete only for me to find a bucket half full of the concrete later that day behind our trash cans. 3 last minute cancellations later, we finally told him not to bother as we will have another company do the fix for us. 

The company who will now be doing the fix has done other A+ work and commented that normally they would not take a job with the previous work being done so poorly.","{""Friends"":86,""Location"":""San Antonio, TX"",""Photos"":26,""Reviews_made"":8,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ffRj7SnCvbD_AN072YTITg"",""Username"":""Mark B.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CXhPbUwSpRz-PxYDsOWh5Q/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yzaufTL2F4rEmlpPCQ9HHQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rufujTbNrg9BuCwppli8eQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d5jlBxwpAnIhbMzWvm9HEw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gsqXIDqy4vbDffh_3wZe3Q/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jb4Abg6nx4UmCa50GQpfxg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/J8jxzv7bEuQjCMIiw55prQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OpBMOBn14TVyD8gs-W-jHA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1atK3ZcxSsLPQLk6zaiWNw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pbO07NyQcHpSpODAbFiQIA/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",2,"","0 check-in","ADVANCED CONCRETE DESIGNS"
"foundation-support-specialists-san-antonio-2","""13/09/2022""",1,"I am writing about three encounters I had with this company and a sister company (Drainworks).  

The first encounter was to was a consult about my foundation.  The salesman came out and immediately started badmouthing the company who had done my previous foundation work.  I complained about that and the owner responded/visited, which resulted in a temporary improvement in my opinion of this company.  They did a polyfoam level and concrete repair for my patio and filled the void under my pool (2nd encounter).  Less than two years later, that work is crumbling/heaving and there is more void under the pool.  

They also referred to Drainworks to fix a leak under my slab foundation, which required significant tunneling (3rd encounter).  I was told at the time that this is a sister company and my dealings with Drainworks were with the same admin person who answered for FSS (no results for Drainworks in Yelp).  

From day one, there were problems.  The sub-contracted dig crew blew one of my outlets by plugging in heavy duty equipment without unplugging other devices.  They did not report the problem. I discovered it and required that they fixed it (they did).  Then the crew disregarded my instructions not to use that outlet again, once it was fixed.  They also took longer than promised....said they would be finished in a week but took nearly four weeks.

They tore up my yard and left trash in their wake.  They threw dirt all over my pool equipment and left cement piling caps in my flower beds.  I complained but they had been paid by then and the company was completely non-responsive to my concerns.     

Today,  I learned that they did not properly backfill the work they did.  I am having a foundation repair done now and the new dig crew discovered empty tunnels behind the initial piles of dirt at the front of the tunnel.  The drainworks dig crew also left their trash in the tunnels, including the bottles of beer in the pictures.

I would not use either of these companies ever again and would advise anyone considering using them to steer clear.  They blamed issues on the dig crew, but it is the company who is responsible for the quality of the work. 

Their lack of concern regarding what I COULD see was disturbing.  But I have real hesitancy about the poor quality of what I CANNOT see. Do yourself a favor and find a different company who demonstrates accountability.","{""Friends"":0,""Location"":""San Francisco, CA"",""Photos"":4,""Reviews_made"":2,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=gej_tfp1Oe4I2JF2ACLV9w"",""Username"":""Cynthia V.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Wn6YGLgRgA-HLGulT400Cg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WhSK2-slzRR5T5qo62haXg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dk3yMWfRbiGk5tXkP4fieA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dqGcwi9EFdjoOgsOyiuGoA/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",21,"","0 check-in","Foundation Support Specialists"

"freedom-outdoor-living-san-antonio-4","""28/12/2022""",2,"Mistakes were made over and over had we not caught the mistakes and questioned it, the project manager would have left those very important mistakes as is.

The painter was slow, and would leave the ladder up after he's gone, and leave his equipment all over the place without coming back for days. The weather got bad, and we had to go and police up his materials.

The electrician did a great job, the concrete guy did a great job, I recommended them to some neighbors, but not this company as a whole.

Once the project got started, got the concrete slab and the frame was up in a timely manner, and the rest went down hill from there... weeks without communication unless we ask the project manager for a status.. and then his workers still wouldn't show after he said they would.

They order an excess of materials (way more than 10%) and don't use it all, and yet they take it and keep it... materials we paid for... it's in the contract, that anything leftover, they take. didn't think it would be that much extra wood and bricks left over, for them to use on the next job

Rolando is a great salesmen... but I will not recommend this company to anyone.. my neighbors have been asking and I have told them .. no, not this company.

We got three estimates.. this company was the highest, and now $50K later, it seems like we are getting results from a handy man off the street.

We gave the first deposit on Aug 8th and they didn't start until 29 September (working on plans) and here today on 18 November this project is still not complete.

One would think as long as it's taking there would be no mistakes.

Now that the holidays are upon us there is no telling how long it will take.

I will be sure to update this post, my patience has worn out...there were so many good weather days where this could've been completed with the extra daylight hours, now it's cold and gets dark early, so maybe they'll be done by Christmas.

After more constant gaps in communication, and we requested for Alan to come up, the project was finally completed on 14 December.

They did agree that the framers did some incorrect which caused issues for the roofers.

Again...when my husband pointed it out to Dominic, he blew it off. Had Dominic addressed the issue at that point, all of the re-dos wouldn't have had to be redone.

The gutter company they used had to come out three times, because the gutters were constantly leaking. I hope whenever it rains again, we will not be calling them back.

This experience was like a when a woman goes to a mechanic, and they think she doesn't know anything, and tries to get over on her. Rolando thought he was dealing with rookies and could talk to my husband and me any kind of way.

Alan and Rolando were pleasant to deal with, and addressed our concerns.Had it not been for them, I would've quit and counted it off as money down the drain.

From this experience I will never do anything else to my house, because I'm scared once they start, the drama will too.

To sum it up, once they started, there were major gaps in communication, there were numerous times, I had to reach out and ask, what's the next step and when would they be there.
But Dominic was quick to ask for a check. There were times Dominic would say the workers would be there at a certain time, certain day, and of course no one would show. They brought way too much materials, which was my money wasted.
I will never recommend this company.
The 2 stars are Alan, and Rolando.","{""Friends"":0,""Location"":""Converse, TX"",""Photos"":3,""Reviews_made"":9,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=LHmKFl4UMQO7d8GrrOz-9g"",""Username"":""SaBrina S.""}","null","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""World class Karen"",""Date"":""09/11/2022"",""Title"":""BizUserReviewReply"",""User_Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/buphoto/R_5WL-siJ9cej60nq3wOhg/30s.jpg"",""Username"":""Alan J.""},{""Content"":""I have a project started, cannot wait to to give step by step review of how the total process went.\n\nThe job is not complete, so I can't give a complete rating of exact stars \n\nAt this point i would not recommend the contracted painter and roofers that were contracted for the project.\n\n\nTotal project cost was $50K"",""Date"":""09/11/2022"",""Images"":[],""Username"":""SaBrina S.""}]",4,"","0 check-in","Freedom Outdoor Living"

"compass-landscaping-design-and-build-spring-branch","""02/11/2023""",1,"I hired CL to build a stucco'd concrete and stone fence enclosure and drive-through gate to enclose my dogs, beginning in Aug '22. This was an almost $100k job for a 1.1m dollar new home. At first, Gabe C. seemed understanding and courteous; there were many set-backs with the HOA that had to be sorted through, but we got through them by wittling down the original plan. Gabe is a home-owner in the Mystic Shores community, and said many times that we were neighbors first, and in business together second... I made the customary down payment upon hire, and all subsequent payment requests. There were lots of lost work days due to jobs being put in front of mine, sickness, weather, etc., but I was always understanding and kind to his workers. Many times giving them water, snacks, stuff from my garden, etc.
When the wall was finally constructed and it came time for the stucco to be applied and the gate installed, Gabe's worker could not get the stucco to match the house, as we had agreed (his mason had quit during the job), so I figured out, without complaint, who had originally done the stucco on my house, and hired them to do that portion of the job for an additional $4500, which Gabe was ok with. I later learned that I only got a $750 credit from CL (this figure wasn't given to me until after he quit). Gabe also said the drive-through gate was on order, which turns out was not.
The day after the stucco was done (in one day) by the other company and it was time to schedule paint to be accomplished and the gate installed (that had not come yet, due to it never having been ordered), Gabe informed me that his painter was on other jobs and that this would cause another delay, so I specifically asked how much credit I would get if I hired someone to paint the walls so there wouldn't be another wait. He then informed me that he was quitting the job due to the stucco workers leaving ""a mess"" and that this would be the last day his people would do any more work for me. I did not get a final walk-through, as I requested. This was in early March '23, just before what would have been my son's birthday. I was completely shocked and unprepared for this. Not only did he leave me to do all the painting, gate installation (and ordering), and rock ordering/delivery/installation for 90' of swale some 5 months later, but he then charged me an additional $3k on top of everything he left me to deal with. I was also left with a bunch of construction rubbish in my front yard such as pallets, broken stone, hardened concrete, cut cinder blocks, etc. that I had to have removed. He did not leave any good limestone, and I never got credit for any materials I paid for, but that he took. When I crunched the numbers, it turns out he owed me in excess of $4k, not counting the debris removal, good materials and headache it caused me for him having quit unexpectedly and without cause.  Of course, I never got this refund from him, or even a rebuttal.
There are many more reasons Compass Landscaping did a poor job for me, but I do believe my being an older single female gave Gabe license to take advantage of me, and quitting like he did. Additionally, when I hired him/his company my only child had just died unexpectedly. Gabe knew about this and that I was a disabled war veteran. I would never recommend this company to anyone. It has taken me this long to write a review because of the additional trauma this has caused me. I ended up doing all the unfinished work myself, except for the gate, which was also a hardship in getting this job completed.

Some additional info that might inform anyone considering hiring CL:
Gabe did not come on site to inspect/observe major construction when he said he would
Good construction materials were taken instead of being left for me or credited, per contract
Gabe did a lot of okey-doking, but didn't follow through (i.e. putting trim board up in front to match the house, measuring the columns correctly; I had to get a variance from the HOA for the left side being too tall, etc.)
Gabe was dishonest with me about the gate being ordered
Gabe did not perform a final inspection of the work that was done, so I assume he would not have warrantied said job for 1-year, per contract","{""Friends"":0,""Location"":""TX, TX"",""Photos"":0,""Reviews_made"":4,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=AfRLV1dVlOAgSJ6Pdus_ZA"",""Username"":""Robin R.""}","null","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Robin - Thank you for sharing your experience.  First, I’d like to say that we enter every agreement with the expectation of providing excellent service, a quality product, while being fully transparent.  With this said, we did encounter many issues before the project began and more obstacles after.  For example, the initial concept changed 9 times due to POA guidelines, your angry neighbor and your budget constraints.  As a courtesy, I made these design changes and did not charge you for design time.  I do believe that we are neighbors first.   My statement was true then and holds true today.  Once the project began, the problems that your neighbor caused with the POA did cause significant delays on the project, along with weather, material availability, deliveries and subcontractor schedules.  These delays are not in our control and it is clearly stated in the agreement that you willingly signed.  Furthermore, I made it clear in the beginning that our mason crew was 12 weeks out from starting.  However, against my better judgement, I agreed to work on your project in between other projects.  Lesson learned.\n\tWhen the wall and cap stone were completed, we both realized that our stucco finish did not match your house.  You did hire another contractor for this service.  This contractor left our site a mess, knocked off several cap stones and did not haul his trash away.  Our crew repaired the cap stones at no cost to you or your contractor.  At this point, you informed me that you will be using other contractors to finish certain parts of the project, so I terminated our agreement.  I terminated the project because we were not going to repair damages caused by or clean up after other contractors.  I gave you full credit for materials not used and services not performed.  The amounts credited were based on what I quoted you, not based on what other contractors were charging you.  Again, the refund policy is clearly stated in our agreement that you willingly signed.  All the materials that you listed in your review were left on site per your request.  All is documented in your file with pictures, video and texts.\n\tWhile there are various reasons to do or not to do business with us, it is certainly not because we take advantage of people or lie to our customers.  We treat all people with respect and dignity without judgment.  We do this regardless of age, gender, marital status, Veteran, Non-Veteran or having a recently deceased child.  While this project did not meet either of our expectations, we still value the opportunity and have learned from this experience.

I saw all the good reviews here, and Bret was one of three vendors I got bids from. When I saw the pictures, and he explained the process, I knew this would be a good option. The sales process was painless, we had a couple of weeks to wait before our place in line was up (completely expected this during high season.). They got to us sooner than I expected, and on day 1 covered our pool, moved all the furniture and ground off the old surface. Day 2 involved putting down a base, and subsequent days were creating the stone look we wanted. The crew was amazing, they were friendly, and seem to love their work. The choices of design and color seem almost infinite. They provide sample boards so you can sign off before the final coatings go on. The final product was just amazing, and the crew made sure everything was cleaned up when they finished. For just a little more than the KoolDeck quotes, this just looks a million percent better.

"risen-foundation-solutions-san-antonio","""16/05/2023""",5,"We were in the process of buying a home in San Antonio, Texas and we were in our option period. We were content with the home but we also had concerns about the status of the foundation. The current owner had listed previous foundation repairs but had no paperwork available. We decided to do some research on foundation repair companies here in San Antonio to have peace of mind and to help us decide what we to do moving forward. Based on the reviews, their website, and their lifetime warranty, we felt very confident reaching out to Risen Foundations to perform an inspection on the home. Our first point of contact was Letty, who was very helpful in setting up the appointment. Letty was also very considerate regarding our option period, which was about to end soon. We were also told that Kip would be the individual who would be doing our foundation inspection/bid.

On the day of the inspection, Kip was communicative with us before arriving to the location. Upon arriving and throughout the entire time he was there, Kip was very personable and professional. He did a very thorough inspection and he took his time when it came to explaining his findings, what they meant, and what it could lead to if they were not addressed in the near future. Kip also took his time addressing our concerns and questions and walked with us throughout the inside and outside of the home so that we had a full understanding of what was going on. Kip was aware that our option period ended the next day and he made sure to have the report ready so that we could provide it to our agent and the seller.

I personally know nothing about foundation repairs, however, when reading through the report we were given, everything seemed very reasonable and in line with the extensive amount of work that would be involved. The lifetime warranty offered by Risen Foundations was also a huge confidence booster. Unfortunately, we tried to negotiate with the home seller but we were unable to reach an agreement that would allow us to move further with purchasing of the home. Nonetheless, we are very grateful to have found Risen Foundation Solutions and were very impressed with the customer service we received from start to end. We will continue to reach out to Risen Foundations for any foundation concerns or repairs that we may need as we continue our search for a home. We will also always recommend Risen Foundations from now on to anyone who may be in need of foundation services.

Overall, it was a top-notch experience and we could not have asked for more from a company that prioritizes quality, customer service, and professionalism.","{""Friends"":0,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/4avS-ga3gBSH1TAjUM286w/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""San Antonio, TX"",""Photos"":0,""Reviews_made"":1,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=s2E_cgoEXooYCfMOg1QKQg"",""Username"":""Rodolfo H.""}","null","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Thank you for the detailed review of your experience!"",""Date"":""27/06/2023"",""Title"":""BizUserReviewReply"",""User_Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/buphoto/4ukb9KE5fHJvnjfAOw0hZg/30s.jpg"",""Username"":""Letty E.""}]",5,"","0 check-in","Risen Foundation Solutions"

So I did my quote bids thru Yelp to get an irrigation system done in our backyard. Villa Irrigation popped up and asked for my contact info and number to reach out for a consultation.
1st red flag: several days went by no calls whatsoever so I replied back with a ""?"" and eventually called their number on their Yelp page and Brandon answered . I was relieved when he apologized and told me this Friday (which was the next day) between 10am to 11am someone will come to give an actual quote. 

2nd red flag: Friday morning went by, no one came, no calls whatsoever. I texted Brandon and informed him no one came by. Several minutes later, I got a call from Brandon stating the truck apparently broke down and apologized and said tomorrow (Saturday) someone will be there between 10am-11am

3rd flag: no one came. no text. no call. nada.

Keep note that the positive reviews were months ago. Now, they have changed and my initial impression of this company is totally unprofessional.

"perma-pier-foundation-repair-of-texas-san-antonio","""24/03/2022""",1,"Customer be aware, before you deal with this company see what kind of set up, they have to make more money. This is from my experience. purchased a house which had a foundation problem that was repaired in 2016 by this company with a transferable lifetime warranty. On the paper they have $100 transfer fee I called them to transfer to find out that the fee is changed to $250 & you have to do a water & Sewer hydrostatic test which cost $400 to $600 but they do it with their recommended company for $350 & I have three months to transfer. not knowing any better I picked their company to be told I need another test done which will cost another $450 & God knows what would be next & what else they will charge for. Most companies do not ask for the water & Sewer test as part of their transfer only company as such. Please pay attention when you are hiring a foundation company & don't pick Perma Pier Foundation Repair of Texas. No matter how long they've been in business I believe they are organized & structured to make a lot more money from one project. I am looking at a few of the reviews which are positive. they are happy there was no foundation problem and giving a positive review not the ones that actually did business with them when asked to show some proof. that make you think! think before doing business with this company & others like perma Pier Foundation Repair of Texas.



To recap on my review: received a number to call the company, as a result  they are working with me on the timing  to transfer the warranty as needed & honoring their $100 transfer fee even though that was not a huge or important part of my review yet good to know, Hoping they get to the part  of which & why they are making the plumbing test  mandatory which in fact they mean Water Pressure & Sewer Hydrostatic costly test  part of their transfer policy, I was told it would be discussed in their next meeting. I am hoping to see it taken out of the requirement.

"foundation-support-specialists-san-antonio-2","""26/02/2018""",5,"Let me start off by saying thank you to Foundation Support Specialists. You guys did an amazing job. My foundation repair started long before FSS arrived. About 6 years ago I had my foundation repaired by one of the concrete guys. I spent the money to have the cracking in my home repaired and things seemed to be great. A few years later I noticed my cracking was back. My home had begun to settled again. After fighting with that company about trying to get warranty work, they finally relented. The warranty work was completed and I again spent the money to have all the interior drywall repaired. Fast forward 3 more years and again found myself in the same position. Walls were cracking up, my foundation was moving, AGAIN! This time the company would not warranty the work. That is when I decided to call someone else. I was sick of paying money for a fix that wouldn't last. After talking with a few companies, I decided to go with Foundation Support Specialists. I loved how their piers are installed to bedrock. Finally, a fix I knew would work. FSS came out to work on my home in June 2017. They dug their holes and started starting installing the galvanized piping. It was fascinating to watch. David was kind and courteous and took the time to explain how the piers were being installed. After the installation was completed the guys did a great job cleaning up. They made a serious effort to disturb as little of my garden as possible and it showed. Here I am nearly a year after the fix and my house is looking great. FSS is not the low bidder. But the quality of the products and the expert installation are well worth the extra money. I wish I had saved the money on my original foundation repair and all the drywall repairs and just gone with Foundation Support Specialists the first time. I would have saved money in the end. Instead I had to make the mistake of trying to save a few bucks and it ended up costing me more in the end. I highly recommend FSS. Don't fall into the same trap I did.

I had a void under my garage from a City water line break ~20 years ago and at the time, three piers were installed on one side of the garage.  Over the 20 years since then, I started to see more cracking on both sides of the garage, continued movement of cracking in the stone veneer on the front of the house and a hollow sound when stomping on the garage floor. I called a couple ""foundation"" companies... including the one from 20 years ago and they all wanted to add more piers and ignore the fact the garage was hollow underneath. I was actually thinking about hiring somebody to demo the garage interior, fill the void and re-pour concrete. That's when I called CRC.  They came out and started drilling holes and found there was a 2 foot void under a majority of the garage!  I had two cars parked in there for years! It took ~13 yards of cement slurry to fill the void, but the garage is solid now and there's no more hollow echoing when tapping on the concrete.  The guys showed up on time and did a great job fixing the garage as well as cleaning up after completion.

If his ""project manager"" Jay gives you a quote please research yourself to ask additional questions that you as a customer would not think of. He just answers yes for the sale so we had documented issues from pergola repair to cement pour to a distasteful most horrible concrete stain! He does not communicate well when it comes to issues against his work. Just because you respond or have your secretary respond to appease us still doesn't mean you rectified the issues. Mike holds no accountability for sloppy work, no apologies for sending an inexperienced laborer to do the concrete staining as a last step for our $6500 project. 

The worker he sent out had no direction, not enough equipment didn't tape the sides of my house while spray stain and was very hard to communicate with due to language barrier. After the owner Mike  was informed the hour after the guy left.. later on that NIGHT he passively aggressively tells me ( via email) that me as the customer was being rude, complained each time something was done and the infamous statement of ""I've been doing this for 20 years"". Hometown Decking, in my case those years of qualifications aa joke because in this industry you should not be proud of the work you allowed to be left on my new 450 sq ft concrete patio with no refund or an apology for the inconvenience.

Looks like Chris must've paid to have the review removed since that's the only way it can be removed from Yelp. The work was very sloppy and left looking like shit. My brick on my back patio was not laid back correctly and they lied to my landlord about the work done. They had to come back out due to not leveling my master bedroom. My landlord was told it was leveled a bit but needed more. I was told verbatim by the workers "" I'll be honest with you. We didn't do anything to the back room. They didn't tell us too."" They left my gate unable to close knowing I have small children and a dog. The pipes cracked in multiple places when they were done with the second round. Instead of telling me, the person who resides in the home and the person who was home the entire time trying to do schooling with my 3 children. They packed their shit up and left. I found out from my landlord the next day. Thought because I am a smoker myself that it was ok to come high to the jobsite. I heard one of the guys tell the other outside my bedroom window. ""Don't worry he's cool. I came high as fuck last time but it was all good."" Very sloppy work and very unprofessional company. They seemed to be in a hurry the first time they came. Stayed later than usual so they could go home for the weekend. Still unable to finish i was left with holes everywhere all weekend. The second round they were supposed to come on Thursday and Friday and just didn't show up on Thursday. Didnt have the time to call and let us know they wouldn't be coming either. Took my landlord calling them late afternoon to find out they weren't going to come. I guess thats what you get when you deal with a company who's office is in an old mall/college dorm. I'm almost positive Chris will deny this as well. I'm perfectly fine with providing my service location. House on Newport Avenue. I've never seen a foundation company leave this kind of mess.

Devin worked with us on expanding our old one car driveway to this beautiful two car one. But in our discussions, we told him how we wanted a gate and would likely need a new fence as well. It became clear we would need a new retaining wall to make this happen the way we wanted it to. He was patient and asked the right questions to help us connect the dots for what it would take to finish the project as we imagined.

"foundation-support-specialists-san-antonio-2","""23/02/2024""",1,"First, I want to note that I have never written an online review for anything.  But, my concern about Foundation Support Specialists is so strong, that I feel I need to do a public service by posting this review. I'll explain.

My house was built in 1978. I bought the house in 2006. So, I've been living in the house for 18 years. In early 2022, I finished an extensive remodel. My house is 2 stories. After the remodel, I've been hearing lots of settling noises that I never heard before (pops and cracks). This is my first house and I have never had a foundation issue, and I know nothing about foundations. I saw an ad for Foundation Support Specialists offering a free inspection (not realizing at the time that all foundation companies offer free inspections), so I decided to call them and see if the pops and cracks were possibly related to a foundation issue, somehow caused by the remodel.

The rep from Foundation Support Specialists was courteous and professional - no issues there. He drew up detailed elevation plans and then told me that, yes, I do have foundation issues! He said my house was sinking on one side by over 1 inch in the worst spot, and that it would need to be addressed ASAP or things could get much worse. He then gave an estimate of approximately $18,000!! I was freaked out. He did offer me a 10% discount on the spot - I remember the final estimate with the discount was around $16,000. Again, he told me that the foundation would continue to sink if I didn't address this soon. The solution proposed was using around 8 or 9 piers under the house to prop it back up. To do this properly would also involve tearing up part of my deck and putting it back together - which would incur additional costs. After I began worrying about my deck, he did say I could skip one of the piers if I didn't want to touch the deck. Needless to say, I was freaked out about the huge expense of roughly $16,000!  But I was also quite panicked about the idea of my house continuing to sink. I knew I had no choice but to fix the issue. But, at $16,000, I definitely wanted to talk to some other companies. At this point, I had no reason to think that Foundation Support Specialists was a bad company. But, when I got the other opinions, that's what caused me to write this review.

I quickly arranged free foundation inspections with 3 local companies in Austin that all had sparkling reviews on Yelp and elsewhere. I wanted to make sure I got reputable companies given that I knew I had a major house repair issue.

To wrap this up: all 3 of the local companies did the exact same process of measuring elevations and drawing diagrams. They all came up with the same measurements as Foundation Support Specialists. But, and, this is the kicker - all 3 of these companies said that my foundation didn't need any immediate work, and probably would never need any work!!  Why did they say this when they had the exact same measurements? It's because they actually are honest and did some additional analysis of my house. Specifically, as stated above, my house was built in 1978. There is a pine wall where the house has sunk. The pine wall actually shows a bit of the effects of the sinking (e.g. some very slightly misaligned pine boards). I have pictures of my house when I bought it from 2006. The pine wall in 2006 looks exactly the same as it does in 2024! In addition, my house shows absolutely zero signs of any other foundation issues - there are no cracks in my drywall, there are no exterior cracks in the brick or siding. Because of these facts, all 3 of the other companies concluded that my house likely sunk into its current elevations a long time ago - likely soon after it was built in 1978.  Also, all 3 companies offered to come back to my house and monitor to see if there any changes 6 months from now. But, all 3 were certain that I had nothing to worry about.

In conclusion, I don't want to say outright that Foundation Support Specialists are dishonest and just trying to take your money. But, I will say this: at best, the rep for Foundation Support Specialists was untrained and simply didn't think about the fact that there was no actual evidence in the house of a foundation issue other than the elevation drop on one side, or to think about the possibility that the house settled into its position a long time ago and there are no current signs that there is anything wrong. However, my rep seemed very well informed - there was nothing that seemed like he didn't know what he was doing. At worst, they are crooked and trying to use scare tactics to take your money and hope you don't get other opinions. I've given you the full story and you can draw your own conclusions. But, I would stay far away from them. 

One last note: I asked one of the other 3 companies the cost to fix the issue if it ever did need to be fixed - he said $7-8K using the same fix as Foundation Support Specialists. Remember, I was quoted $16-18K! Another warning for all of you!","{""Friends"":0,""Location"":""Austin, TX"",""Photos"":0,""Reviews_made"":1,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=7mLfDAuW3bETacZUaMbLOQ"",""Username"":""Scott U.""}","null","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Hi Scott.

Point of Contact: Alex Moya Jr.
Main goals needed: Patio (2 levels with stairs), slab for trash bins, driveway extension 

I was originally contacted by Alex with Ace Contractors (Ace Concrete) via Yelp. It was not the best start. There was some missed communication, missed appointments. We ended up meeting in person because he did apologize for the missed appointments. He explained why it happened I I appreciated his honesty. But due to the overall situation I actually chose not to go with his company. However, some thing took place and the contractor I did end up going with talked a high game and couldn't own up to what was being requested. 

I can be an easy going person if the communication is there but once you start ghosting me, there is a much more by the books kind of guy (some would say douche-like). With that being said, I fired the contractor and reached back out to Alex. He was willing to take on my project. Now this is where the rollercoaster began. He was patient while waiting for me to re-route my irrigation which took maybe two weeks. 

Once the project finally got started, we sent over a drawing with some notes (my first mistake was not removing some of the irrigation notes), he sent us over a proposal (my second mistake was not fully reviewing his scope on the proposal). I would say his mistake was not addressing the notes I'm the drawing we sent over but since I failed to properly review his proposal, a change order was needed. The next hurdle of miscommunication was the lower level of the patio was (notated in the drawing) to be level with the AC pad. We discussed this verbally and he hadentioned due to grading issues the lower level needed to be higher than the AC pad. During this talk, I agreed. Then my dead brain cells kicked in and said something that came off as sneaky and underhanded (I deeply apologize for that). However, he took the higher road and made it happen, he got the lower portion of the patio to be level with the AC pad. 

Now as in many project poop happens and you both just need to wipe it off and meet in the middle. 

Alex Moya Jr. did this and more. The temps were high during this project. He was dealing with me through the whole thing. He in no way, shape or form let me down with the results. My Patio looks amazing, the slab for my bins look great, the driveway extension looks wonderful.

They came out and evaluated my house. The salesman was very nice and seemed very knowledgable. I hired them and they were supposed to be at my house at 8am. They showed up at 10:00am. That was ok I guess but this became a common theme. The foreman was nice and polite but he left about 15 minutes after the work started. The dirt that was dug up in my yard was placed straight on the ground even though they said it would be on tarps. Now there are large areas of dead grass in my yard. They removed several bushes from my yard and they were replaced but have since died. After all the holes were dug I asked them why there were only 15 holes when they said there would be 18. They said ""sorry we missed that"" After I made them dig the remaining holes they began the ""lift."" Mind you the foreman was never present. They told me it would be a ""synchronized lift together."" The guys were all doing different things. One man was on the cell phone and was not lifting like the others. As the house started to rise I heard a loud pop. The sheet rock, window, and tile popped and broke. They told me that this kind of thing happens and that I was responsible. After the entire process was complete I started to see new cracks in my sheet rock. I called several times and finally got  the foreman to come take a look at my house. He told me that everything was ""normal."" I was not reassured by this so I asked another company to come take a look at my house. They determined that the perimeter of my house was 2 inches higher than the the middle and that was adding tension to the rest of my house and that was why I was experiencing the new cracks. I spoke with several people at Perma Pier and they told me that my house was not coverd under warranty becuase I had poor drainage. They neve mentioned that poor drainage would void my warranty and they certainly never told me that I needed to address that problem in the first place. On top of that we have not had any rain since they worked on my house. I have now hired an attorny and we are filing suit. I have since had another company come out and assess the problem. Suprisingly they determined that the piers were installed incorrectly and that the cable from the ""cable anchored pier"" that perma pier sold me was not even installed.

I had a quote from them last year but was unable to commit the time to get it done. When I was finally ready this month I had them come out and do another reading; as well as two other companies. The reading Brent did almost mirrored the one from last year, while the other two showed differences and didn't agree where the foundation was lower or higher. I chose BATS for the consistency and the patience Brent had in explaining the readings and the process. The crew came out and dug the holes for twelve steel piers required to stabilize my foundation.

I recently engaged LevelSmart Foundation Repair Inc. for a foundation issue, and I couldn't be more satisfied with their service. Colton, the representative, was not only friendly but also provided detailed estimates and explained the entire process thoroughly.

The pricing was competitive, and they efficiently handled permits from both cable and utility services. The three-day project was executed with professionalism, and the daily site cleanups were a nice touch.

Upon completion, they seamlessly restored my sidewalk pavement, demonstrating their commitment to both structural integrity and aesthetics. I highly recommend LevelSmart for their excellent service, competitive pricing, and attention to detail. The added bonus of a lifetime warranty makes them a top choice for foundation repairs.","{""Friends"":61,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/xqTIW84zMkuNMjOn8PIi1Q/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Seattle, WA"",""Photos"":961,""Reviews_made"":74,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=75JZU7mXfNe2EYgMx8ZP_w"",""Username"":""SeaKyle C.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GG2j5DyMGkmrf__ikQr05A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-SoQ4PeAF-gqw-PaWQdleQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TG6i33LlDYCX0KEbMNbeEg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uYOJ5xTYiGA2xcF5vTtcow/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HXNeR2fSJzmVyBRYJZ384A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/a7w8eDQpwAaxMnjR4RuO1A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ICJzkm8EkX67ECIeiMsFsg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/10FbZ7padph-9TiXCr4Y0A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/tDHa_7YvzzXigP1OZ5zidw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Thank you so much for the kind words!

Sure, I've given their number and website address to tons of people who have raved about my patio after seeing it firsthand or in photos, but I have been slack at getting the word out beyond my circle of friends, so I'm here to rectify that.

Mike and his crew did an exceptional job with my patio and pergola.  The communication was clear and quick, and they completed the work amazingly fast.  I had heard so many stories of contractors taking forever, so I figured it would take a long time, but they prepped the area on one day, poured and stamped the cement the next day, and about two weeks later, after the cement cured, they finished it up in one day.  I couldn't believe the turnaround time, especially after talking to people who'd had numerous concerns over timelines with their contractors.  Mike even submitted my Homeowners Association paperwork for me.   Their outstanding customer service, quality work, and quick turnaround are the reasons for my glowing review.  Seriously, call them if you need work done.  You won't find a better contractor for this type of stuff.","{""Friends"":3,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/s7V3UvdFUoxT7gwWAgk0Lg/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Austin, TX"",""Photos"":1,""Reviews_made"":8,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=99VJ381H_yOfcHMC-Jfykg"",""Username"":""Barbara K.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0g-XQoPjOr6kHwTkIhCHLg/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",25,"","0 check-in","Hometown Decking and Decorative Concrete"

"lukes-concrete-spring-branch","""12/09/2023""",2,"Decided to use Luke's Concrete for a widening project on my driveway. After reading past reviews I figured they were reputable! Boy was I wrong. 

Initial quote process was good (I received 3 quotes and they were in the middle as far as pricing). Quality of the pour in front good, quality of the poor in the back not so much.

 Front pour: They told me that they would put a big rock back to where it belonged but then just gave me excuses that they ""moved the rock the best they could"" due to the size (They moved this rock in the beginning to pour the cement over 3 feet!) But they can't move it out of my ditch??? 

Other excuse was they didn't want to ""break the concrete by moving it anymore"" Said they pushed it back up? (Take a look at my pictures, still sitting in the ditch by the drain). 

Back pour: Out back I questioned the slope of the pour as when it rains it would go directly into the corner of my garage foundation. He said they dug it out more to level it out but after the pouring of concrete it slopes directly to my foundation. Another issue is I asked them to backfill out back once the forms were pulled up, Taylor and another worker went back to do this but it was not done. (See pictures) I had to complete the one side as I now have a trailer I put in the back. 

I DO NOT RECOMMEND Luke's as they talk a good game to get your business but do not finish the project as they state!","{""Friends"":0,""Location"":""TX, TX"",""Photos"":9,""Reviews_made"":43,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=y3gEFbI5PVGPCLne3JZPAQ"",""Username"":""Roger L.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vR653XmnFqibDPMDBmMc4w/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ln2DqG_abSiGCX_QMaIYwA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/16UlwM1X_fSVqbBuFI-Ryg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WiPoyfFcGHRcRPMJ7E_-Zg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LsTRsGybiEM9JQT87rWTEw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Do73sZ4m7yMia_gxFJqoyw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",4,"","0 check-in","Luke's Concrete"

I reached out to the office manager to request someone else come out (since I was already off from work) and received no response. 

I sent a follow-up text stating that I would be taking my business elsewhere, and the response I got back was ""Sorry, I'm just an office manager"".

"foundation-support-specialists-san-antonio-2","""08/08/2019""",1,"This is an updated review (original 31 July 2019). See update at the bottom. I tried to update the original review, but looks like my update deleted the original.   reposting the original plus the update.

My main complaint is that the company broke my sprinklers. 

In mid may, I told two people about the problem. Nothing was done.  On 28 May, I sent a letter via UPS to the owners of the company.  The letter was signed for on 29 May.  Two weeks later, when I didn't hear anything, I sent an email through the Better Business Bureau. As of today, 31 Jul, I still have not heard anything.

Below is a snippet of the letter I mailed to the owners. 

When Jared arrived at my house to give me an estimate, I said, ""I have sprinklers.  Is that going to be a problem?"" He replied, ""No. We deal with sprinklers all the time.""
On the first day that crew was at my house, Robert asked me if I had sprinklers. I said ""Yes.""

The crew finished work on Friday, 17 May.  The following Monday morning,  I attempted to use my sprinklers, but none of the zones worked.  The control box worked and showed water flowing.

The same day (Monday, 20 May), I texted Josh -  telling him that my sprinklers were not working.  A few hours later Robert texted me asking if he could come to fix my concrete on Tuesday. I asked him if he could come on Wednesday instead and I told him that my sprinklers also were not working.
(more on my concrete below)

Robert and crew arrived on Wednesday morning, 22 May. I showed Robert my concrete problems, and I showed him my sprinkler control box.  About two to three  hours later, he knocked on my door to tell me  ""I fixed the concrete as best I could."" I said, ""What about the sprinklers?""  He said, ""I don't know about sprinklers."" 

Since I couldn't get anyone at your company to even look at my sprinklers, I researched how to troubleshoot the issue.  I turned on my sprinkler control then checked my water meter.  Although no zones were working, the water meter showed that water was running.  
This seems to indicate that one of the crew cut my line while digging.  Later I realized that one of the holes had water in it before it was filled back in - even though I took great pains to keep out rain water (more on the holes below) - more evidence of a broken line.

To read the entire letter (4 pages), please go to bit.ly/FSSComplaint or tinyurl.com/FSSComplaint

Almost forgot to mention, my foundation has moved significantly since they were here in May even though I have been watering.  Looks like I""m going to have shell out several hundred dollars for an independent engineer to go over their work. I might have to take this to court.
They claim to hire one of those [independent engineer], but I did not see that guy take any measurements.

Update.  I received a voicemail from Josh on 7 August 2019 (after my 31 July posting).  He said he saw an online review about my house shifting and he wanted to come out and take measurements.
He didn't mention any other problems (the the letter and email that I sent in May and June)
I texted the below response on 8 Aug, 2019 at approximately 9:30 AM

""Good morning.  I'm sorry I missed your call.  This is ...Thank you for your voice message reference my house shifting.  As stated in my letter sent in May and my email sent in June, I am requesting a refund of my final payment so that I can fix my sprinklers and because of other issues.

The correct action to repair my peer and beam foundation was not done, so they had to redo the work.  This was after I kept on them to review the engineer's report that clearly showed all of the levels were worse after they did the work.  When redoing it, which I am happy to say they agreed to, they didn't put in as many new footings as they should have, seemingly to avoid fixing the bathroom floor I had just replaced.  Once done, they left large mounds of dirt around and along 1/2 of the house without pounding it down.  This led to giant tunnels being created when it rained which caused water to get under the house.  Their response was that I needed to buy dirt from Home Depot and fill them in and pound them out....since they didn't.","{""Friends"":3,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/e3xE4N150foXlk-D3sJblQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Austin, TX"",""Photos"":1,""Reviews_made"":7,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=YeF49k_D2IUT55JbeIExRQ"",""Username"":""Jennifer M.""}","null","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Thanks for sharing your feedback.

"g-l-hunt-foundation-repair-san-antonio","""03/04/2024""",3,"We had gotten quotes from several companies for our foundation repair but ultimately ended up going with G.L. Hunt because they were the only ones who honored our wishes for the scope of work, instead of doing an insane amount of unnecessary and costly repairs that would have required us to move out for upwards of 2 weeks. The salesman, Nick, told us that we would need to have our front porch stairs taken apart, and a palm moved from the area of work. He could not explain why, and we opted not to move the palm, and agreed to be ok if it got damaged. We hired a private contractor to evaluate our stairs, and he completely disagreed with Nick's assessment, and charged us to dismantle and reassemble, what he recommended for the stairs based upon Nick's assessment. I sent photos to Nick and he said that it would be fine, but no further detail. 
The workers arrived several hours late the first day and completely ravaged our front porch and side of the house. They left ~8 foot deep open holes in the backyard without alerting us, and with 3 very active dogs, that could have been extremely bad, had one of them fallen in because the holes were left uncovered. But the work was completed and at the end of the second day, they left, leaving a mess behind, and told us they would be back the next day to clean up. The did not arrive until the late afternoon to clean up, which was fine, and they did an OK job, but our beautiful white house was completely covered in muddy handprints that I am still scrubbing off a week later. 
After all of that, they didn't even need to move the palm we were advised to move, so luckily we hadn't done it, but they did move it's sister, and when they put it back, they put it back over a foot away from where it was. Not a HUGE deal, but now it looks like crap and we're not capable of moving it alone without hiring someone. They completely destroyed the edges and finish of our stairs because they did not protect them, and turns out, none of stairs disassembly was even needed, so that was more money wasted. Add to that, they stole some of our personal tools that we had outside, and claimed them as their own I suppose, and boke our hose connector, and also lost a piece of the nozzle. All in all, the work seems to be good so far, time will tell. Overall, small things, but huge annoyances that are now our issues to deal with, because we were ill-advised to begin with.","{""Friends"":116,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/oy73CIyHHYdhOzfIrjkZTA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Austin, TX"",""Photos"":359,""Reviews_made"":244,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jbgGoTl11dDpcw0IYeL58g"",""Username"":""Laurene T.""}","null","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Thank you for sharing your experience.

Isaias made the process easy and was so communicative throughout. He kept me updated while the forms were being laid and even came up with ideas as we went along that ended up making the final result even better. He always let me know right away how much more it would be when we made adjustments so that there were no surprises.

"baird-foundation-repair-san-antonio-3","""15/04/2024""",1,"In early August, 2023 I was going to have a french drain done, or a trench, to redirect the water flow around my driveway when it rains. A neighbor of mine had heard about Baird Foundation and recommended I give them a call. I called Baird about fixing my driveway which had tilted slightly from side to side over the years, the walkway to the front door, and also seven slabs around my pool that had moved. Upon the initial inspection on August 18, I told the Baird representative that I was thinking of having a french drain put in but the Baird representative was confident that Baird Foundation could fix the issues and gave me an estimate. I called him back a couple of days later and signed on. A couple of weeks later, as the crew was setting up to start, the lead technician said he ""could lift the slab up, but could not push it down"" (referring to the corner of the drive that had tilted up slightly. I told him if they can fix the problem with the drive that I was okay with that corner raised a bit and they started to work.   When I returned from work that day, they were trying to jack up the corner of my garage and a third technician arrived and told them to stop. The driveway is not attached to the garage and I did not authorize Baird to do any work on the garage foundation. They finished later that afternoon and returned the next day to finish their work. When they finished, the lead technician told me he ""could not fix the driveway"". If the technician had said they could not fix the drive, I would have told him to leave it, and just do the other areas of the job. It was later twice implied by the General Manager that I was lying about this. That was quite offensive. I inspected the other work they did and found that  the slabs around the pool, and the walkway out front, were not adjusted properly. I told him I could not sign off on it until the work was done correctly. I later spoke with the Baird General Manager and sent her pictures of the errors in their work. Weeks later in mid-October, another one of their crews, including their field supervisor, came back and corrected the slab work around the pool and the walkway leading to the front door. On October 26th, the last day that their field supervisor was there, I asked him ""if you knew you couldn't fix the driveway, why did you work on it in the first place?"" He said ""to stabilize it, to fill in any pockets or crevices."" He also said maybe I should try the french drain that I spoke about.
In a phone call trying to come up with a resolution, Baird's General Manager, asked me what I thought they should do. I told her that ""Baird should remove the driveway portion from the bill."" Two of their employees have already said ""they knew they couldn't fix it."" She then said that I was trying to cheat Baird out of money when in fact, that is what this company has done to me. While most of the employees were very polite and friendly, this management was highly unprofessional. The attached photos of my driveway (shot the last day the supervisor was at my house) are what they left me with.
Based on my experience with this company, I would not recommend them to anyone.","{""Friends"":0,""Location"":""San Antonio, TX"",""Photos"":2,""Reviews_made"":1,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3aFoCyjCw2y1GGjuqqxbVg"",""Username"":""Jerry K.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xSrpG1RycwzqaPqf3AReBg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vlYn5aPN5g0CqFyQNhKiHA/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",2,"","0 check-in","Baird Foundation Repair"

They obviously didn't weed eat or spray weed killer before they put down the new weed barrier because weeds are growing through all the seams and around all the trees.  They also didn't cut holes in the weed barrier for the irrigation heads.  The layer of mulch is so thin it barely covered the weed barrier and after the first rain I had bare spots everywhere.

"freedom-outdoor-living-san-antonio-4","""17/11/2023""",1,"***PLEASE READ BEFORE HIRING FREEDOM***We hired Freedom Outdoor Living to expand our back patio and build a pergola. While there are aspects of the project that we feel they did a good job with (mainly the pergola), we feel it's important to warn other potential customers of the issues we have experienced working with them. 
First, this company uses subcontractors, and unfortunately, many times they didn't show up at all to perform the work they were scheduled to do or performed the work incorrectly. This led to significant delays throughout the project and was extremely frustrating. It put us in the position of constantly following up to ensure the work was done and done right. As an example, the concrete steps we asked them to build were initially very narrow and a safety hazard. We asked them to correct that. Our pergola was not built correctly according to the design, and we had to ask them to correct that as well. The railings around the patio were installed incorrectly, and again we had to ask them to correct this. We understood that the stain of the existing patio may never perfectly match the new concrete patio but the colors are not even close.  Dominic was our main point of contact with Freedom and was apologetic every time this occurred (which was frequently) and let us know the excuses the subcontractors provided. They did make these corrections, but what I'm not sure Dominic (and Allen) with Freedom understand is that this is absolutely a reflection on their company when they hire subcontractors that either unreliable, incompetent, just ""don't care,"" or all of the above. Unfortunately, they had already stained our concrete steps so when they did fix the prior sloppy work, the stain didn't match the remaining patio. 
The biggest complaint that we have with them is that once the entire project was complete (in April 2023), within a month the concrete overlay that they had put on our patio to match the extended patio we built (which it never did) started to deteriorate in a section of the patio. (We now know from speaking with others who have knowledge of concrete work that this overlay was not installed correctly from the beginning). We immediately informed them of the issue and 3 months later (after repeated texts) they repaired the section of damaged overlay without restaining. In other words, we had a large white patch of concrete on our brown stained patio for another 2-3 months. Again, after repeated texts and excuses, they finally let us know they would be sending someone out to stain the patched area of concrete. We had asked them to ensure that the patched area matched the remaining concrete and asked them to fix the issue with the entire patio being multiple different shades of stain. To this they asked us to either pay $3800 to correct the poor staining all done on our patio by THEIR contractors or only stain the patched area of concrete for free. We absolutely refuse to pay Freedom more for THEIR work that was not done right to begin with and agreed for them to only stain the patched area (with the expectation that it would, at least, match the existing patio). Of course, it doesn't and looks awful. I included a picture here so you can see how bad this looks. We are now left with a concrete patio that is 4 different shades of brown and is an eyesore. We have texted Allen and Dominic multiple times to ask that they do the right thing and restain our patio so that all of THEIR work is one color. What is very disappointing is they are not even responding to us anymore. 
There is no sense of wanting to do the right thing for their customer or even taking pride in the work they are doing. It is very disheartening that after trying to be understanding with them throughout all the delays/failures in the project once they got their money they really didn't seem to care. 
Allan/Dominic/Freedom Outdoor Living, if you are reading this and would like to correct your staining work on our patio and make this right, we would gladly welcome it and be happy to amend this review.","{""Friends"":0,""Location"":""San Antonio, TX"",""Photos"":1,""Reviews_made"":1,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JBI7tHoBXiw4Kzv8r3Rb4A"",""Username"":""Vipul G.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/X70WF_LxHybE7wToHdf-WQ/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",2,"","0 check-in","Freedom Outdoor Living"

"the-foundation-guru-austin","""25/08/2020""",5,"If you're considering a foundation repair, you need to contact Foundation Guru first!

Foundation Guru provides foundation inspection exclusively, nothing to ""sell"" us on.  We employed Lisa's services as a 2nd opinion a few days after a (very) brief inspection and quote from a foundation repair company.  We were quoted $11,000+ by a foundation repair company without the specific inspection details or measurements, only the number of piers they plan to use, the various caveats about what they can and cannot be held liable for and the price.

The same day as the inspection, Lisa provided an elevation drawing of the house and exterior, where measurements were taken and the measurement relative to the origin (center of the first floor).  Her measurements were  taken using the same laser equipment as the repair company, the overall elevation differences were very nearly the same (3/4"" compared to 1/2"" in 10').  The professional inspection outcome was very different from the foundation repair company:  our foundation is in fine shape, actually well-inside the allowed 1.5"" within 10 feet of a freshly-poured slab in TX.  Lisa's professional opinion is to be concerned when 3"" in 10' difference is found.  That's a big difference from 3/4"" in 10' ... and $11,000.

She provided helpful grounds suggestions to help maintain the ground around the slab, recommended gutters around the house to prevent water pooling/drainage issues, diagrammed problem areas to address.

Lisa is a consummate professional.  Get your foundation inspected before paying anyone that tells you it needs Thousands of Dollars...and it doesn't.","{""Friends"":0,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/cJM1X2ZXlKoAc8CwueGURw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Cedar Park, TX"",""Photos"":5,""Reviews_made"":7,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=2XdWmBk3hByJwDSzFFPHiw"",""Username"":""Joy M.""}","null","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Thank you so much for the amazing review!

"the-foundation-guru-austin","""04/11/2021""",5,"I found Foundation Guru on Yelp and hired them to inspect my foundation few months after purchasing my house. The home inspection during the purchase said that the foundation was fine, but I wanted to get some knowledge about how to care for the foundation in my home and get a second opinion on some cosmetic issues that I noticed. I spoke to Lisa over the phone and she was able to schedule me the very next day. 

On the day of the inspection, Thomas arrived on time and took several measurements. I also pointed out the issues I was noticing and he patiently explained everything. He also made several recommendations, especially regarding drainage around the house.  All his findings and measurements were documented in a report that he emailed to me.  

Overall, I was pleased and glad I got it done. I felt that it provided a snapshot of the current state of the foundation, for future reference. It also, was useful to get educated on the basics of foundation maintenance. Lastly, it provided peace of mind.

It was my first time eating eegra and was surprised that it had a nice kick of spice. We chose the three appetizers mentioned above on our sampler platter which also comes with pita. The pita was fresh and soft. 

We then ordered saffron rice, falafels and grilled mushrooms. The rice is regular basmati rice with a touch of saffron rice, nothing spectacular. I expected the falafels to be a lot more flavorful, found them just okay. The mushrooms are marinated in a sweet sauce, good. 

Turkish coffee had great flavor too. Am unsure though if it is common for Turkish coffee to have a lot of coffee grounds in the cup. I got two cups of coffee (yeah, greedy me but in my defense the cups are tiny!) and they both had a fair share of coffee grounds at the bottom.

The hummus is like something out of a dream and tastes like heaven. It has a smooth consistency that's served chilled and has cream in it.

They serve a variety of tapas. So really there is something here for everyone. The chicken- is succulent and tender. The saffron rice is delicate and complements the food very nicely. Other highlights include an especially crisp Greek Salad offering and dolmas galore. Mmm...yummeh!

In addition to great meal items, the menu offers up some rather tasty dessert offerings. I recently had a sponge cake with cream that had rosewater in it. I cannot remember what the specific name of it is, but it's pretty magnificent.

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""11/03/2014""",2,"I'd been to Cafe Izmir exactly once before. The food was meh and pricey. The interior and service fine but something there feels a little off. So I hadn't been back for several years. But then I had a groupon to use up. Even with $20 off (from the groupon), my friend and I felt totally ripped off.

Basically, nothing seemed fresh, except the pita. 
We went at the beginning of their night - 6pm (they open at 5:30), so everything should have been fresh, fresh fresh. A spread of mostly veggies was ordered.

The spicy hummus is very good but a tiny portion for price ($6) and pita to go with it is extra ($2) and not enough to get through the hummus with.

Grilled veggies (6.25) were a nice variety but came out room temperature, as did the grilled tomatoes ($3) and extremely mediocre, overcooked and rubbery ""Pomegranate Shrimp Spicy"" (9.95 for 6) which seemed to be missing the spicy part. All of these seemed pre-cooked. 

A baked sweet potato was the only thing served hot (other than that aforementioned great pita bread!) and was tasty but not so much on the mediterranean tip. More American holiday.

We also got the olives ($5 for about 15). 

To top it off, we were seated in a corner that seemed cozy but it felt like the two tables next to us were sitting with us. It was also next to the bathroom which had clearly just been cleaned with chemical cleaner. Not the best smell mingling with room-temperature, pre-cooked food.

The table was tiny and plates were not cleared efficiently. Until near the end when a fella came by and kept trying to take a few we weren't done with, yet. (ha!)

Man! I hate to have had such a bad experience there because half the menu is vegan and there are so many veg options.

What can you do?

The hummus is absolutely amazing and addictive!!!  They have three choices too - regular hummus, chipotle hummus and ""date night"" hummus (which has no garlic - I prefer the regular hummus).  The babaganoush has a great flavor and texture.  The tabouli salad is fresh and tangy.  I am picky about falafel and I just so happen LOVE Café Izmir's!  The veggie piroshkis are soooo delicious!  And the dolmas too!  I've had just about everything there but the last time I went I ordered something I had never had - the grilled lamb chops.  I am sad that I have wasted so many years of not eating that amazing, delectable dish!!!  The outside of the lamb chop was just the right crispiness and the inside cooked to perfection.  Those alone are worth the drive to Dallas from Frisco! 
 
The customer service there is number ONE!  Nick always waits on me there and he is so attentive and helpful, of course any server you get there will be the same!

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""29/08/2021""",5,"I moved to Dallas for the first time in late 1994. I was more or less a kid back then, but I clearly remember Cafe Izmir as one of the Greenville Avenue mainstays. Years later, it remains an institution. Clearly, the owners of Cafe Izmir have never lost sight of their roots. The food is every bit as delicious, but it remains a place where one can expect the level of care and compassion from those who work there that one would receive from a beloved friend or family member. I can think of few restaurants that embody this level of genuine care, warmth, and hospitality for their customers. The ambiance exudes a rustic and romantic charm that sets it apart as well, and on the night we recently visited, was perfectly paired with beautiful live music. 

In terms of food specifics, the classic hummus has always been one of the best iterations in town, but the chipotle hummus is almost more amazing. The dinner for two offers flexible choices and is a sensational value at just $65, and the portions are super generous. The beef tenderloin and chicken were both tender and perfectly seasoned. Even the tzatziki is deliciously set apart from everywhere else -- thick and expertly seasoned. You will definitely not leave this place hungry! 

If I could change only a few things about Cafe Izmir it would be these: I do wish they had a liquor license so that raki could be enjoyed, and I'd love to see the addition of a few more classic Turkish dishes such as doner/Iskander, cerkez tavugu, bolu pilic yogurtlu, mantarli tavuk, etc. But even without any of those things, this restaurant still manages to be epic.","{""Friends"":47,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/z_KNv3A6kjvXPFZR7qZGGw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Dallas, TX"",""Photos"":19,""Reviews_made"":142,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=usMJ2YerUPlMcFmLgiMgUQ"",""Username"":""Kelly M.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aIUSYcL5rp54f1Eu1kPFPw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",41,"","0 check-in","Cafe Izmir"

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""01/10/2015""",4,"MEDITERRANEAN MAMBA! 

My experience with Cafe Izmir began with their catering, which consisted of many different flavors. From cous cous to lamb rolls to hummus and more, the tastes and flavors seem to dance on my tongue. The food overall was light, but filling, without any overpowering flavors. My first impression was that their food presentation was vivid and lively, with so many colors and different vegetables with their distinct flavors. Easiest way to imagine this is to take an entire buffet and stuff it into catering dishes. SImply wonderful.

And now, the glorious food.

The Food: LAMB ROLL LAMBADA. I tried the lamb roll, hummus/pita bread, chicken kabob, saffron rice, roasted vegetables and roasted hot peppers.

Lamb Roll: HOLY. Don't underestimate this lamb-tacquito-looking wrap, it packs a lot of baked leg of lamb and pico de gallo. It bursts with lamby goodness, without too much of the gamey flavor. The freshness and tartness of the pico de gallo balances the meaty lamb. The lamb roll is filling and is one of the top tapas that they offer. Make no mistake, if you like lamb, definitely try the lamb roll. 

Hummus/Pita Bread: TYPICAL HUMMUS AND PITA. There is not much you can do with hummus and pita, except to infuse strong and complex flavors. Here, the hummus looks literally like beige-colored blended chickpeas without any additional color or herbs/spices. The hummus and pita bread were plain compared to all the other flavors that Cafe Izmir had to offer (-1 star). 

Chicken Kabob: Chicken goodness. Marinated and grilled in their spice blend termed Izmir spices. Chewy, but tasty. The spices gave the chicken a flair, even though the chicken was in between moist and dry. Overall, the spices gave it flavor and I live for the flavor of chickeny goodness.

Saffron Rice: Simple basmati rice with saffron-infused flavor. Pairs well with the chicken kabob and lamb roll, as well as the char-flavor of the roasted vegetables and hot peppers. Great palate cleanser and highly recommend over the pita and hummus.

Roasted Vegetables: BBQ VEGETABLES. Broccoli, bell peppers, and onions in a roasted vegetable medley. Drizzled with the perfect amount of olive oil such that the vegetables retain their natural flavors, as well as the gift that roasting provides them. Can stand alone as a solid dish and main entree for vegetarians.

Roasted Hot Peppers: Spicy, tangy, and charred flavor that provide an edge to Mediterranean food. These peppers are serrano peppers, so they add a bit of unexpected heat, but really goes well with the spices and flavors of Cafe Izmir's Mediterranean cuisine. The flavor is less intense compared to jalapenos and due to the roasting, but it adds a sweetness cut by spiciness. Wonderful.

The Verdict: THE FLAVORS KEEP DANCING. 

Overall wonderful flavors and balances between meat and vegetables, and spicy, salty, and sweet. The lamb roll is a must try: light, meaty, and refreshing. I'd skip the typical plain hummus and pita, and go for their saffron rice and/or flavored hummus. The roasted vegetables and hot peppers can stand alone as a dish, but they pair very well with the Mediterranean spices and dishes. Definitely try Cafe Izmir and you'll remember the savory dance on your taste buds.","{""Friends"":490,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/jdxpIH1utm_ryctsVsxc7A/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""El Paso, TX"",""Photos"":312,""Reviews_made"":165,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DooN-gRzhAdZgmJK2NfdpA"",""Username"":""Vic F.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ItDYooyCHDFPzVcEzqagdw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",127,"","0 check-in","Cafe Izmir"

We walked in and there's a little roof covered patio looking area but I wanted to sit inside because the lights were dim and they had candles on the table.

We got the pita and hummus for appz. Then I ordered the beef tenderloin plate and Maeeeday ordered the chicken kabob. Nothing is touching the beef tenderloin! It was perfectly juicy and tender with the taste of some Mediterranean spice rub and the taste of char where it was probably cooked came out of the red meat. Every bite that I took was full of beefy tenderness. The rice was just some wild rice pilaf looking thing and it was served with a grilled tomato, which was good as well.

The hummus & pita bread is sooooooo delicious and garlicky!  I ordered the coconut shrimp tapas and my friend ordered the falafel tapas plate which came with more humus!  The coconut shrimp came with a wonderful marmalade dipping sauce but I actually preferred the taste of the falafel and will order it the next time I stop in.  The enclosed patio dining area was full of diners and seemed to be the most popular area to sit.  Seems like it would be a very romantic setting for an evening visit as well!  They also play really cool, hip music which adds a great vibe to the whole dining experience. This is a great place to come for lunch or an evening out on the town.","{""Friends"":478,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/dRqiA8OZanE3pGI7E1floA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Rockwall, TX"",""Photos"":817,""Reviews_made"":570,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JljyPnPaZbqqxzoyp2da7Q"",""Username"":""Diane D.""}","null","[{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Hi Diane, \nI wanted to first Thank you for visiting us at Cafe Izmir, I am so upset that I had just left the Cafe, right before you got there or we would not have this issue, I totally agree with you and I have told everyone numerous times how to handle customer situations, WE absolutely did not handle this the right way, I did sit down with everyone today and had a very long talk with all of them, you are right, no where on the voucher says dinner only, even if it had, they should have called me or just take care of it to make you happy, We always preach a 100% customer satisfaction to our staff, for the past 19 years, I always try my hardest to make sure EVERY customer that enters our restaurant leaves 100% satisfied, this did not happen on your visit, I am NOT writing to you about your review, I am writing to you because I value you as a guest that came to our home and left unhappy, and that is not what we are about and I want you to know that.\nI will do everything in my power to make sure this never happens again, I would like to buy you and your guest lunch or dinner, which ever you prefer and try to change your bad experience in to a real cafe Izmir experience, please allow me to do so.\nI am here to help and please, give me a chance to make you as happy as every guest that comes in to our little Cafe, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart.\n\nMy email is beau@izmirgroup.com  please let me know how I can help.\nThank you and I hope to hear from you soon.\n\nsincerely Beau Nazary"",""Date"":""06/08/2015"",""Title"":""BizUserReviewReply"",""User_Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/buphoto/GhESDlmyvtLsCZCm1yAsEA/30s.jpg"",""Username"":""Beau N.""},{""Content"":""I received a very sincere and heartfelt apology from the owner who apologized for his lunch staff being newly hired and mishandling the entire situation.

I was all ready to give this restaurant a 5-star review but ended up leaving very disappointed when I was informed by the female manager that my Living Social coupon - which was due to expire in a couple of weeks, could not be honored for lunch (even though it doesn't say that anywhere in the offer's fine print.)\n\nWhen I first presented the coupon to our young waiter, he said, \""Oh, I'm afraid we can't take this.  It's only good for dine-in\"".  I looked at him kinda puzzled and said, \""That's just what we got done doing - dining in\"".  Then after getting clarification from the manger, he returned and said that the offer was only good for DINNER and I was not the first customer that had to be made aware of their policy.  Again, no where on the coupon does it say, \""Valid for dinner only\"".  Had I known that, I would not have bothered to purchase this offer as this location is only convenient for lunch during the work week.\n\nTalk about bogus!  The manager told me I had two weeks to use it before it expired on Aug. 13, and that I could either gift it to someone or ask Living Social for a refund.  She was absolutely no help at all.  Not only that, but she told me that it was Living Social's fault for not stipulating that the offer is only good for DINNER and that they've been trying to get them to make the correction.  That's funny because I just received another Living Social offer TODAY in my in-box from Cafe Izmir and again, no where on that new offer does it say it can only be used at dinner.  She also said that if I go to Groupon and Yelp and viewed the same offer, that is says valid for dinner only.  Well, I beg to differ.  Just so happens that when I checked in upon arrival, a $20 for $10 offer popped up on my screen.  Too bad I didn't bother to look at it while I was still in the restaurant because AGAIN, no where on the Yelp offer does it say \""not valid at lunch\"" or \""dinner only offer\"".  If you don't believe me, go onto Yelp and check out the offer for yourself.\n\nCustomers are going to be upset (and rightfully so), when they purchase this offer thinking they can use it anytime only to be turned down when they show up for lunch.  I guess since the dinner menu prices are always higher than lunch, it's more profitable for them to want to restrict the coupon to dinner only and that's fine - but they need to state that in the fine print instead of putting the blame on Living Social for not getting the advertisement correct.  One thing's for certain, they either need to honor the coupon deals that they're putting out on Living Social or just stop advertising all together."",""Date"":""03/08/2015"",""Images"":[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sz4hu_XXBNBOiTYTJJSVHw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6uAbkBiT5xiPVAt3ncZrwQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Gyie1IpXFl-gQTDf-qXYjQ/348s.jpg""],""User_Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/dRqiA8OZanE3pGI7E1floA/60s.jpg"",""Username"":""Diane D.""}]",207,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Cafe Izmir"

The first wine I ordered on the menu was unavailable. The second, more expensive wine is :- . Wait staff is very nice, but hurried. Place is humming but missing the passion of owner/chef. More to come... Began with the baba - delicious. The addition of grilled onion is unexpected and welcomed. The Greek salad is dressed with a dressing that included balsamic vinegar. Not my choice but I guess many approve. For me, the dressing should be simple, olive oil, lemon, vinegar, and seasoning. Less is more.yes. The rice is very white. I suspect the saffron rice contains a few drops of saffron oil. Look. I get it. This place is great by some standards. I travel - a lot - and my radar has this place in a solid good range.

It was a lil different compares to other Mediterranean restaurants that I have been to. The orders were smaller and cheaper if you choose the Tapas, (i think that's wat it's called)they'll bring your dishes out in small plates and you can either eat them all by yourself or share with friends. The other option you have is family style. It's about $42. You get 1 big plate with samples of  most stuff on the menu (not all). Me and my sister with no doubt would be able to finish that plate. But I ended up going with the Tapas option cuz i like to have the freedom of choosing wat i want and sample them that way instead of being overwhelm by all the food. 
We ordered the chicken kabob, beef kabob, grilled shrimp, cabbage roll, rice, and of course hummus.
Ya'll probably heard enough about the hummus. But here it goes again. Get it! it's awesome! you wont regret it!
Chicken kabob and the grilled shrimp were so delicious. We ended up ordering another chicken kabob.
The beef kabob and cabbage roll were meh. Definitely not my favorite.
The rice was nothing special. 
The atmosphere was nice until it got so packed.

Their hummus truly lives up to their claim to be the best.   So smooth and creamy.   Snappy seasonings keep you coming back for more.   

Beef pirashki was a delightful grilled flatbread that reminds you of a blend of food that you have had across the global cuisine space.   It's like a cross between an egg roll,  burrito, and fajita.

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""25/03/2016""",4,"A wonderful fusion of Mediterranean and Spanish cuisine. 

I came with some friends in search of some good food and I wasn't let down.

I really enjoy the atmosphere, even though its a really small space. The night I was there they had a Spanish guitarist playing at the bar. The outdoor patio is well lit and sets the ambiance for a good night. Kudos on the interior and exterior decorations

They serve everything in Tapas, so my friends and I ordered a lot of things and shared it. We ended up getting regular hummus with pita bread, chili pepper hummus, falalfel, a sweet potato, dolmas, and pirashki. The chili pepper hummus and pirashki were definitely the highlights of the meal. The pirashki have a nice texture and have a great bold flavor on the inside. The chili pepper hummus is a little spicy, but its quite addictive after several bites.  The pita bread had some chew, but it was quite soft and moist. The falalfel had great flavor but I wish it was crunchier. Albilad I think makes the best falalfel in town, but Izmir still has a great foundation in flavor. The dolmas were also good, but I wish it wasnt so chewy for the grape leaves. The sweet potatoes were nothing special, but I still enjoyed them even it was simply steamed. The regular hummus was good, but the uniqueness of the chili pepper hummus outweighed it halfway through the meal. 

I will definitely eat here again, although it can get pricey fairly easily (especially if you're ordering drinks on top of that.).

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""01/10/2010""",5,"I have been going to Cafe Izmir since 1999.  YES TEN YEARS!!!... and the food has remained consistent all these years.  The portions are Mediterranean tapas sized and sharing is encouraged.  The hummus is amazing, extra garlicy... they recently added a ""date night"" hummus for those who don't want to smell like a garlic farm.

Tuesdays nights you will find reduced priced tapas.  If you are willing to wait, its worth it.  Be patient and don't throw a fit, just enjoy the wine and the company you are with.... AGAIN you might wait for an hour for a table depending on how well you treat the staff... The nicer and pleasant you are, the faster you will be served. DON'T GO ON TUESDAYS IF YOU ARE IN A RUSH.

Fridays nights have a date night menu.  Its a pre selected meal with a bottle of wine.  Its more than enough food for two people, and you are welcomed to add more dishes (ie the hummus).

Besides the hummus, I like the beef kabob and the priakshi.  The chicken kabobs are a little dry for me.  the food is served quickly once ordered starting with cold dishes followed by the hot dishes.

The staff is hit or miss... some of the servers are extremely pleasant, and others seem to be stand offish... but the will diminish as you ask them more questions and just make small talk.

Cafe Izmir is an amazing restaurant experience at a reasonable price.  The first things I noticed were the beautiful lighting and great decor.  There was also a very talented live musician who sang a wide variety of songs in English and Spanish with his own unique spin to the tunes.

Cafe Izmir is famous for its award-winning hummus, and it certainly lived up to my expectations.  It was tasty and one-of-a-kind!  We got the falafel and chicken kabob platters: both tasty and well-worth the price!  

Our waiter was boisterous and cheery, smiling and cracking jokes--when the musician played one of his favorite songs, he started dancing and singing along with a passion that was fun to see.

The food was great, surpassed my expectations. 
The beef tenderloin was cooked medium rare, the chicken was fantastic. I enjoyed everything that I ate from the beginning to the end. The grilled vegetables have pineapple pieces hidden on the bottom of the pile, a surprising twist. 
I requested that the eegra be served warm, combining it with the tabouli on the pita bread which is complimentary by the way was a good choice.

Cafe Izmir has a right to claim to have the ""best hummus in the universe"". The texture was exceptionally smooth and full of flavor. A new favorite spot for me visit.

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""12/04/2010""",3,"So a bunch of us went to Cafe Izmir to celebrate my friend's 30th birthday. We were seated in the covered patio along with another big group that was there as a bachelorette party. It was quite cramped and very hard to get around with that many people. Even for the waiter because he accidentally spilled wine all over one of the ladies with the bachelorette party. Ooops!

About half of the party ordered off the tapas menu and the other half ordered family style. Family style was momma's choice and included hummus, pita bread, chicken salad, tabouli, saffron rice, meat dish and a veggie dish. The meat dish tonight had lamb rolls, chicken kabobs and beef kabobs. My favorites of the night was the hummus, pita bread and lamb roll.  The lamb roll contained slow roasted shredded leg of lamb with pico de gallo wrapped in a hot tortilla. I totally agree with everyone that the hummus and pita bread is the best in Dallas. I am still craving it now. I could have made my whole meal out of the hummus and pita bread. 

The waitstaff was as accommodating as could be with such a large group. Some of us did not get our meals but they did what they could to make us happy. They gave us an extra meat dish and a round of shots on the house. 

Although small and quaint, I loved the atmosphere of Cafe Izmir with the string of lights, live guitarist and uneven floor boards. What I didn't love was the bathrooms were small and cramped. There was not much wiggle room in the hallway for you to wait if both bathrooms were occupied. 

Even with all the chaos I'd come back again (but with a much smaller group).","{""Friends"":508,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/jOFQVxtugSQAqxUAjlNbnw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Dallas, TX"",""Photos"":1983,""Reviews_made"":275,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9t-K8axdDdf-BP8eG9o_ag"",""Username"":""Kellie K.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6jnnnOjQcopkv_do-1sR6Q/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kwXG0tlk7SOddiqDXDxPXA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CjAREFXlo0QGLOOrwpvERg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GtMAWeSQ2yOneSP3e_3tIQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4CZQwhlj5Y-vULklCgPJvw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",217,"","0 check-in","Cafe Izmir"

Every person working here  is gracious (our server was kind and made sure we were taken care of every step of the way) and lovely and it makes the meal such a sweet experience.

The hummus was delicious and definitely garlicky in a good way, and the other plates were also amazing, especially the quail and the lamb wraps. Seriously, the lamb wraps were amazing - it was cooked perfectly and well-seasoned. Their house sangria was also nice, and it goes under the category of sangrias with less fruit and more wine. 

The only point that I found was that the table we were seated at had an obvious leak in the ceiling, but being too focused on the food I forgot to bring it up.

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""13/07/2011""",4,"Greetings again fellow foodie fans.  I'm writing this particular review for one Shristi (hope I spelled it right), bartender at Izmir.  No doubt the regulars know her or are getting to.  I've been to Izmir several times and the service is typically pretty good, but on this Tuesday... yes Tuesday it was outstanding.

I wish there were halves... this would be a 4.5 review 5 for Shristi and a solid 4 for food.  No offense Izmir, it is devine, delicious and excellently prepared.  But I will always have a place in my heart for Cafe Ba Ba Reeba in Chicago/Lincoln Park.  Different as they are Spanish and these are more Turk/Crete; but I digress.

Back to Shristi.  Me and my buddy get there at 5:00 because on Tuesday this place is a nuthouse.  $2 tapas and $14 pitchers of Sangria will do that ;).  Being the relatively seasoned tapas eaters that we are; hummus and tabouleh right off the bat and a pitcher of Sangria to start things off.  Right away, Shristi smiles and knows we're down for the goodness.  Our sangria is right out and shortly behind it our appetizers.  She kept a careful eye w/o being intrusive spotting like a hawk the right time for more pita; suggested delicious items on the menu and even repoured our glasses from the pitcher when she came by.  Incredibly ebullient personality, knowledge and love of the food.  I will *always* ask for her when I get back and I won't be surprised if she knows my name (I'm not going to count on it though ;) ).

Food... excellent as always!  We had the dolmeh, flavorful, right tooth in the rice with a nice lime/lemon finish.  Beef kebob was cooked perfectly and the sumac did it right (suggestion from Shristi).  Its the brown stuff on the table for those that didn't know.  We also got falafal.  Ok... word to the wise here, get this earlier on... oh my lord... it was incredibly tasty but it was like it expanded in my stomach and sopped up all the sangria... woofda!  Lamb wrap was very good too.

Now, after a delicious Turkish meal... coffee is in order.  We already knew we were going to want it and apparently so did Shristi as she just said ""coffee?"" with a knowing look.

Best cup of coffee I've had in as long as I can remember since I left Austin, Tx and lost my Texspresso access...  perfectly sweetened, not too hot and straight out delicious.  Delicious I tell you!!

So, coffee down, I'm thinking Grappa / Uzo or something like it.  Shristi says ""port"".  We say, why thank you I think we will!

Wish I could recall the name of it but it was excellent and closed out the meal just right.  Can't wait to get back there again.

Ask for Shristi y'all (that's Christy with a SH - heh how she explained it).

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""20/07/2014""",2,"Date night and we wanted comfort food i.e. Persian. This came up in our search. We had been really excited about this because of the reviews but it was unfortunately a letdown. 

First we arrived to find no parking - only forced valet. $5 okay.

We go in and after a moment were greeted and asked to wait inside at the bar. After over 15 minutes of waiting we were told that a table would be cleared shortly. However, there had been quite a few tables cleared and ready while we waited. Perhaps we were overlooked by the larger parties that arrived after us? I must still be used to the big city where if you wait that long for a table you are given comp drinks or something. 

We were finally given a table and I will admit it was a nice corner booth. So a star for ambiance. Our waiter came and asked for our drinks order and handed us menus and left. On the menu was a sheet of paper listing the possible items to order. I suppose it is a do-it-yourself theme but typically a restaurant will ask if it is your first time dining at their establishment and will give an explanation of what to do. 

We ordered the plate of the beef kabob (Persian style koobideh), tabuli, side of Moma's rice, and the saffron chicken. 

The tabuli and also warmed pita bread came out quickly. Not bad but I've had better. The side salad from the plate dish was served next - nice seasoning for a side salad. Then the rest of our meal was brought and it all kinda of went downhill from there. I asked for a side of lime - it wasn't brought till I had finished eating. The side of rice didn't have saffron as indicated on the menu. Perhaps I misread? The saffron chicken was spicy and dry. The koobideh I wouldn't call Persian, it wasn't... I'm not sure what spice they used but something they used made us feel sick for the rest of the night.

The restaurant was busy, quite popular though with a definitely older crowd (we didn't see any Middle Easterns dining there...) That can understandably cause a wait as they were short-staffed. However, needing to ask over 4 times for our check and continuing to wait for it to be brought while our server took additional orders at other tables, as well as continued to serve others was annoying. Really slow refills on water too.

Maybe it was an off night for them but we won't be back.","{""Friends"":267,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/RqrFW69Z2mmnYaEhEqmEMw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""San Juan Capistrano, CA"",""Photos"":1097,""Reviews_made"":385,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=VrAIOTUqv-BZJXhhLAOCrA"",""Username"":""Janna C.""}","null","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",175,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Cafe Izmir"
"cafe-izmir-dallas","""18/11/2013""",4,"We bought the Yelp deal (great, BTW), and began to enjoy a romantic dinner.

When we arrived we were greeted right away by a very friendly man.

We chose to sit inside as the mood and lighting were just a little bit more romantic. We ordered the Sangria (special on Sunday--YAY!), and as everyone else has said, it was superb. We started off with Hummus and Babaghonoush (sp?). The pita bread was absolutely fantastic and both dips were flavorful and garlicy.

This is where I thought Cafe Izmir could have done better.  While everyone else is raving about the service, I thought there were bouts of inconsistency in their service. It started out very well, but then, after the appetizers, they seemed to forget about us. We were ready to order and seemed like one couple of maybe five in the place. It took them a while to notice were ready to order and the busboy/helper gave me a paper and told me I could order by using the paper and pen, or I could wait for our server. I opted for the paper and pen route, and then the helper took the paper and away he went. From there, it seemed to get better, the food came out (tapas-style, so as it was ready), and it was FABULOUS.

We had the Dolmas; they were spicy (not heat, but SPICE). The grape leaves were tender and flavorful and they held together nicely.

For sides we had the rice and Falafel. Both were great and complimented the meal wonderfully.

The meats we had were the Piroshki and Lamb Rolls. Both were absolutely to die for. The Lamb Rolls come in a tortilla stuffed with a spicy pico de gallo mixture. They are very good and the lamb is oh so tender. The Piroshki's were wrapped in a wonton type roll and deep fried. Very good mixture inside of cabbage, etc. 

We will definitely be back, as I am sure we encountered the waiter in an off-moment, as everyone else raves about the service.","{""Friends"":466,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/_Um-hz_c5-XCeOThrKuRCg/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Dallas, TX"",""Photos"":162,""Reviews_made"":229,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=zfVU_50y377Gxj169iWyzw"",""Username"":""Sarah M.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/K1tEDLGdwcVWGqHG-mORhg/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",176,"","0 check-in","Cafe Izmir"

I gotta say, the waiter we had that night was pretty cool. He was super enthusiast and seemed like he loved his job. Even though our waiter was great, the service ended up kindna slow as they got busier. Anyways to the food, I really like how this place offers tapas style so I can try more stuff. We pretty much got what the waiter recommended.  The hummus was the best and only thing that was good that night. It was garlic-y, smooth and fine in texture. Most hummus elsewhere is too gritty for me. The chicken, lamb, and falafel were alright at most. The meat was too dry. Even though the lamb wasn't gamey, it lacked the true essence of lamb, and wasn't good. I ended up only eating the hummus with pita bread to get full while neglecting the rest of the food...that's always a bad sign.

We had a Groupon, but the $10 for $20 deal via Yelp with a free hummus for a check-in is a much better deal. With a Groupon, it didn't allow the waiter to enter more than one code for the free hummus.

My family ordered freshly made Pita bread and hummus, falafel, chicken, beef kebob platters and pomegranate shrimp platters with veggie plates. I did question if their grandma was in the back bc the entrees had the authentic taste.

Recommendation| I would highly recommend this restaurant to others when they want to explore international food. There is not an american twist, 100% authentic even with the staff. The owner, Bo, is amazing individual and great to talk to. He took time to talk to our family for my mom and sisters birthday celebration. I would say the only con, is the $5 valet, I would rather have it to be complementary and we tip the valet. Other than that, LOVE this place.","{""Friends"":1048,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/iC9kogpcCFTnzfHyd90GDA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Garland, TX"",""Photos"":225,""Reviews_made"":99,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=VIBhuWPRT1iN2Lf2I3urTQ"",""Username"":""Andrew T.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xZwR7FCpDrI9N5AxCtxIlw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",152,"","0 check-in","Cafe Izmir"

We went last night for cheap tapas night.  I arrived first so they didn't seat me, but let me grab a seat at the bar, so I went ahead and ordered a bottle of wine.  When my friend arrived we were seated on the patio and ordered the magical pita and hummus to start while we looked over the menu.  You can basically make a meal out of the pita and hummus, and by the amount of leftover food we did.

Service is spot on.  The same people have been working there as long as I can remember, and are just as friendly and helpful.  This place still gets super crowded on Tuesday's, but these folks have the system down with moving tables for smaller or bigger parties.  Years ago I know that on Tuesday's they wanted to get you in and out, but there doesn't seem to be as much of a rush to sit back and try to finish your drinks.

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""05/08/2013""",5,"Great restaurant to visit if you're looking for somewhere new and intimate. It's located down the street from the Granada Theatre on Greenville so if you've been there then valet at the restaurant is definitely worth it during peak dinner hours. 

It's a small but very romantic setting. The decor is elegant but still allows for semi formal and casual wear, however most people are there for some type of occasion during the weekends. 

The staff is beyond accommodating and friendly, everyone really goes the extra mile to make sure you have an excellent experience. The portions are tapas so you'll be ordering several small dishes; it makes for a different and more interactive dining experience since you'll most likely be sharing a few things.

There is excellent live music on Fridays and Saturdays. The guitarist is not too loud and plays anything from American singer/songwriter hits to Latin guitar, Brazilian romance and even Persian acoustic. It adds nicely to the ambiance. 

The food is some of the best Medittarian/Persian food I've had in Dallas. If you're not sure just ask your waiter what's good, they are all of Persian or Latin descent and very helpful based on your likes and dislikes. 

I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to have an intimate night out or going somewhere different and elegant with a close group of friends.","{""Friends"":40,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/s2npZWcgXZJtoxeSDdtZ1A/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Denton, TX"",""Photos"":10,""Reviews_made"":8,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JSTapqQqCmzmK2CkaiiWgg"",""Username"":""Jesus P.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mAMr_d2jysnUOQ3Dob2ibw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7FElpfoSo8qJQMeAsruwdw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1u3I_yVmUiPA2uWjuASQMw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",183,"","0 check-in","Cafe Izmir"
"cafe-izmir-dallas","""04/03/2013""",5,"It is rare when a place gets everything right.  Cafe Izmir is one of those places. I'm still glowing from a magical evening. I have to say that it is one of the most romantic spots in Dallas. From impeccable service to unbelievable food...it was an almost perfect date night dining experience.  What would have made it perfect? Maybe if they had comped our meal for gracing them with our presence...but I didn't really expect that.

First, let me start by encouraging you to make reservations.  We did not, but I think we just got lucky. We were immediately sat at a very small table for two, and very apologetically told it was the only seat in the house. We found it perfectly acceptable, especially since we showed up unannounced. Not more than ten minutes after we were seated, there were at least five tables on the waiting list.

Second, lets talk ambiance.  Cafe Izmir is very small, but even fully sat with more people waiting at the door, it never felt overcrowded. The overhead lights were dim, but not so much that reading the menu was challenging.  Twinkling strings of white lights added to the romance. The noise level in the bustling restaurant was completely tolerable, and the lovely live guitar music coming from the bar area was at a perfect volume--louder than the buzz of conversations around us, but not so loud that we had to raise our voices to flirt with each other.  The tapas-driven menu is perfect...I always feel like there is something intimate about sharing food.

So let's get to the food.  We started with the hummus (check in on Yelp and it is free!). We passed on the garlic free Date Night Hummus, and threw caution to the wind.  We figured there wouldn't be a problem if we both indulged.  It was a well-calculated risk, the full-flavor hummus was maybe the best in Dallas.  Yes, better than Ali Baba's.  Really. And if either (or both) of us had offending breath, we didn't notice.

Next up was the ground beef kebabs, or Kubideh.  The tapas plate was a nice-sized serving for two and it was excellent.  It came with a bit of ziziki (yogurt and cucumber) sauce that was a nice addition. We also ordered the Pomegranate Shrimp Spicy--five large shrimp over a small serving of rice. An amazing, tart, white wine and pomegranate sauce gives the kick to the shrimp and the rice.  It was a favorite for sure, as was the Saffron Chicken Kabob.  Tender, bone-in, flame-grilled chicken with the perfect amount of seasoning. Yum.

We ordered the grilled vegetables to complement our selections. They were fantastic and we ate every bite of the onion, mushroom, okra, bell pepper, squash, asparagus and pineapple medley.  It was truly a standout.  We also tried the meat dolmas--our server recommended them over the veggie ones.  They were the only sub-perfect element to our meal. The grape leaves were tough and the dolmas fell apart when we tried to eat them. Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't give props to the bread.  It tasted freshly made and authentic.  No prepackage pita here.

Are you hungry yet?  

As wonderful as the food was, the service was even better.  Our waiter was engaging and attentive, our drinks were filled at appropriate times and even the owner came by our table to make sure we were satisfied.  

All of this and we found the prices to be extremely reasonable.  Even more so with a Groupon discount.  Cafe Izmir will definitely be a go-to date night location in the future!","{""Friends"":171,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/fwS793YWk0BmaRKIjBZFDg/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Dallas, TX"",""Photos"":419,""Reviews_made"":369,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=gr2KquqZig9M0bFcc1Enag"",""Username"":""Diana D.""}","null","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",186,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Cafe Izmir"

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""04/12/2017""",1,"I used to go to Cafe Izmir quite regularly when I lived in Downtown Dallas nearly a decade ago, and don't quite remember it proclaiming to be the best hummus in the universe at the time. Now that it has firmly landed in the epicenter of Texas suburbia, (Plano), totally makes sense. It's on the map. All of Middle East, you have been warned. 

To Izmir's credit: The hummus is really quite savory - and on the super velvety side. Unsure about universal appeal though. 

Unfortunately, I have to give this location and experience one star. My mom got food poisoning from the beef kabob, which thankfully I did not have. 

Just in case that was a fluke, we also requested pita that did not get delivered and service was s-l-o-o-o-o-w.","{""Friends"":652,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/XLebj0df9U3PtXMxCAS1Ng/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""New York, NY"",""Photos"":362,""Reviews_made"":374,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=cRonkYAwS6c3XehTH7dxtg"",""Username"":""Spartevan V.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_Cb5uFjrgdRgVaCOIPcTYg/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",89,"","0 check-in","Cafe Izmir"
"cafe-izmir-dallas","""19/01/2016""",4,"Cafe Izmir is a little hole-in-the wall on lower Greenville Ave in Dallas.  They are an established business and have been here for many years.  Their Greek food is very, very good!  The hummus is creamy and freshly made and the pita bread is served hot.  I only wish the hummus was warm and hot cold when served with the pita bread!

They serve a very delicious Turkish Coffee in the most darling teacup.  It's so delicious!! Never had anything like it before!  The ambiance of the restaurant is wonderful as they have little white lights hanging around the porch windows and the lights are dim.  Definitely a place to try!!

One thing that was a bit annoying was we were left to wait for our check for over 30 minutes without anyone coming by and we weren't able to grab anybody.   I was wondering why the check wasn't just dropped at the table after the coffee was served??  This was my only complaint.

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""16/07/2018""",5,"Before I start my review, I'd like to say this. I. Hated. Mediterranean food. When I came to this place, it quite literally rocked my world.
-Hummus. I'm still trying to find a way to marry food. Because I totally would. It doesn't even taste like hummus because it's this beautiful buttery, garlicky, citrus spread. 
-Lamb roll. AMAZING. Comes shredded with tomatoes, rolled in a thin pita type bread. 
-Falafel. Among my once strong hatred of this cuisine, it was incredible. Slightly spicy, and crispy on the outside. 
-Saffron rice. Buttery and spiced. 
-Tzaziki sauce. Not too much Greek yogurt flavoring, which I loved. 
-Sweet potato. O.M.G. It came served whipped and mashed and beautifully sweet. 
-Chicken. Charred and Smokey tm. 
-Beef. Reminded me of a juicy, flavorful hamburger patty, and was perfectly balanced with the saffron rice.

"cafe-izmir-dallas","""23/02/2015""",5,"I go here quite often and as you can imagine there are times on the weekend that it can be packed.    One night my SO and I showed up at just the wrong time.  Everyone seemed to have just sat down, more were standing around and then we arrive.  

We were met by Bo and he had told me that he would take care of us, but that being said there were so many people there was no way to be taken care of the wait staff could barely get through much the less any room to spare.  

""Mom"" walked in like a boss, too my arm and said, ""Bo will take care of you"" and then went to the kitchen.    Again everyone was nice, but there was just nothing to do.  Just as I wondered if I should try my luck somewhere else, a lovely lady, Shristy, pushed her way through the crowd with a glass of wine in one had and a tray in the other.

She said, ""take this"" and held the glass of wine in front of me.  I told her I didn't order wine.  She then asked, ""do you want it?""  I did and stood waiting on a table while I drank two glasses of wine.  By the time one table was ready, there were several available.  Again we just arrived at the wrong time.  

I have never figured out why hummus can be so good.  This is my favorite hummus ever.  We always joke since the bowl is always dry by the time the food arrives.  

The pomegranate shrimp was so tasty with slight sweetness.  There is a ton of flavor packed in them.  With the Dolmas the grape leaves are the perfect tenderness.  The felafel were hot, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. 

If you don't get immediate service ""Sam"" will show up and take your drink order.  It is okay if you don't know what you want, he is always up to give his recommendation, and he has only picked winners for me so far.","{""Friends"":159,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/CCuOVLFXRQa6bYyokZN_tw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Dallas, TX"",""Photos"":162,""Reviews_made"":26,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=hBrV0dXtJmRHTtvK5UShlQ"",""Username"":""Jon M.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kDDMgbnv2M97eizX3y6x-A/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",151,"","0 check-in","Cafe Izmir"
"cafe-izmir-dallas","""01/04/2014""",4,"Okay, like all the cool Dallas eateries, this one has been reviewed to death. So I'll spare you the details of how my meat and humus was seasoned and just get to the nitty gritty.

1. Lotsa people are on here complaining about the valet parking. Yeah, so the lot ain't that big. But have you tried parking, I don't know, ANYWHERE in Dallas? I work at Parkland (the Dallas County hospital for you outta towners) and STILL have to pay to park! Oh, and take a bus to get there once I arrive. So the valet isn't a star-killer for me.

2. The waiter will try and sell you the ""family style meal."" Just don't. It's not bottomless, for one. For another, I went with about 6 people and there simply wasn't enough of everything to go around. I had to order falafel à la carte just to try a piece. For anything more than 4 people, insist everyone get their own orders. You'll get what you want, AND it will be cheaper. This was a bigger crime than the valet parking.

3. And as multiple people have pointed out before me, this is a great place to celebrate a birthday. The waitstaff is indeed attentive, the food good, and each birthday girl got dessert and a bottle of wine to take home.","{""Friends"":470,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/CjzEm3ARH7ccYBPKlMRlMA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Arlington, TX"",""Photos"":283,""Reviews_made"":783,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Qnblk-eX9iuJmK_JEc1nCg"",""Username"":""Christine C.""}","null","[{""Number"":4,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",167,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Cafe Izmir"

BEST hummus. Their tabouli was a little lemony the first time I had it, but when I came back, it was right on point. The chicken is tender and very flavorful. I have had both the chicken kabobs, and the saffron infused chicken. I am not a fan of the lamb rolls. It is basically a tortilla with veggies and some shredded meat they say is lamb. The flavor on that was pretty bland. The veggie plate is good. Perfectly crisp veggies cooked in some kind of oil that has a slightly sweet taste. I also had their Greek cake a la mode. I would at least recommend trying it. It is not as sweet as what I am used to with American desserts, but like I said, I'd recommend trying it as well as the other desserts I saw floating around there.
